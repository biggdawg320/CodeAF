// whose whole purpose is to be asked less permanently increased the asking, in
// a place nothing on screen connected to the key that had been pressed.
//
// A RULE THE PERSON WROTE STILL WINS FOR THE TOOL IT NAMES. `read:prompt` is a

// nothing whatsoever about any other.

// WHAT IS ON IT, and why each entry is safe to leave off the asking:
//
//   - Pure reads of this machine — read, grep, find, ls. Nothing here changes a
//     file, so the blanket mode's prompt is free to land where it matters, on
//     bash, edit and write.
//   - jobs, whose list and output are reads of processes the person already
//     started. Its kill is not on the floor: it inherits the blanket mode,
//     which asks.
//   - The agent's own bookkeeping — remember, track and recall. These write to
//     and read from the memories and working state it keeps for itself
//     (internal/session's memory.go and state.go); no hand outside this process
//     reads them, and asking somebody to approve the agent writing itself a
//     reminder is asking about the wrong thing.
//   - manual, which reads pages compiled into this binary and touches no disk
//     at all (internal/session's tools_manual.go). A person who asks "what can
//     you do" and is answered with a permission prompt has been asked to
//     approve the program looking up its own documentation.
//   - settings, which reads the person's own settings rows back through the
//     registry (internal/session's tools_settings.go). It is manual's shape one
//     file over — the answer to "what is my daily budget" is a lookup, and the
//     credential rows read MASKED through the registry itself
//     ([config.Setting.Secret]), so there is nothing here a prompt would be
//     protecting.
//
// commit is DELIBERATELY NOT HERE, and it is the interesting half of the split.
// It is the fifth hand on the same working state, but it is the only one that
// declares a tracked subgoal FINISHED, and a session that can mark its own work
// done without anyone being asked is a session that can talk itself into done.
// The other four record and read; this one makes a claim.
//
// change_setting is NOT HERE FOR THE SAME REASON, harder. Changing somebody's
// configuration is an ACT and not a read — it writes a file that outlives the
// conversation — so it goes to the person like edit and write do. That split is
// the whole argument for the settings pair being two tools rather than one with
// actions: a rule is written per tool name, so one tool could not have been
// free to read and asked about to write.

//     that changes once a week. internal/config caches nothing on purpose.
//   - Invalidating from the settings panel's write hook would only see the
//     panel. The `change_setting` tool writes the same rows from inside a turn,
//     and /crew writes four of them at once.
//
// A counter bumped by the ONE persisted writer sees all of them, costs an atomic
// load per call when nothing has moved, and holds the lock only to rebuild. A
// mid-session change is honored by the NEXT crew call, which is the promise the
// settings rows now make.

// v3RecentSessionSlots bounds one listing. Twenty is far more than the four the
// welcome box draws and more than a person scrolls a picker past; what it is
// really for is the ceiling on the work — twenty file scans, once, on the
// keystroke that asks (internal/session's Recent bounds the reads too).

// v3RecentSessions is this project's past conversations as the surface lists
// them: the name each one gave itself, the last thing that happened in it, and
// when.
//
// It reads the transcripts rather than opening them — no lock, no replay, no
// agent — which is what lets it list the session the running window is holding
// open, and lets a second window list the first one's conversation while it is
// live (internal/session's peek.go).
//
// An unreadable bucket is an empty list and not an error. This answers a list a
// person may never look at; the one thing it must not do is stop a launch, and
// "no recent sessions" is a true sentence about a machine whose session
// directory cannot be read.
//
// BOTH SHAPES ARE LISTED, because both are on the disk: a session written
// before Decision 26 is a flat transcript and one written after it is a
// folder, and the reader takes the folder's own meta.json as the name and
// the ordering (internal/session's recentplace.go).
