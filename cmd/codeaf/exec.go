// typedDoorContext says who the calls of a command a person typed are made for.
//
// THE MEASURED FAILURE (2026-09-13). Under `simple` the talk pin rides only the
// calls somebody is reading (internal/provider's drawLaneChoice asks the role's
// Visible), and a headless door that stamped nothing ran its leaf as
// [lane.RoleUnknown] — a hidden background errand — so a pinned `codeaf exec`
// went out with no machine named while the row still said one. `codeaf do` and
// `codeaf plan new` are the same shape: one command, one person waiting on it,
// and cmd/codeaf's lanepin_doors_test names all three as the doors whose first
// request must carry the pin.
//
// IT IS A LEAF AND NOT THE TALK, because each of these is one leaf's work and
// not a conversation: there is no turn loop, no room and no transcript here,
// and [lane.RoleLeafAttached] is exactly "that leaf, with somebody in front of
// it".
//
// AND THE DOOR IS THE MARK. Nothing in this binary launches these commands as
// a child — every spawner builds its leaves in process (subharness.go's
// buildLinear, chatv3_subharness.go's registry, the subharness's own asks in
// subharness_env.go, which names [lane.RoleLeafUnattended] itself) and none of
// them reaches this function. So there is no env var or flag to key on and
// none is invented: arriving here IS the fact that a person typed the command.
//
// IT SAYS THE FACT TWICE BECAUSE TWO THINGS READ IT: the leaf this door runs
// itself takes the role off its context, and everything `codeaf do` runs
// through the session's own executor — its planning pass, its nodes — takes
// the fact from the process-wide latch (internal/provider's readByAPerson and
// internal/session's someoneIsWatching), which no context reaches.
