// counting what the runtime does with the ones above it, not by taste — see
// [tuneForTheSurface] for the census.
const surfaceMaxProcs = 8

// tuneForTheSurface caps the scheduler and raises the heap target for a command
// that is about to draw one, and IT IS CALLED FROM THE DISPATCH BELOW rather
// than from main.
//
// The default heap target collects several times before the surface is even
// drawn, and none of those collections free anything worth the pause: the launch
// path allocates a graph snapshot, a catalog, and a thread, and then keeps them.
// Trading a few megabytes of resident memory for those cycles is the right side
// of that bargain for a tool somebody is sitting in front of.
//
// IT IS THE WRONG SIDE FOR EVERY OTHER COMMAND, which is why this is not in
// main. `do`, `run`, `exec`, `engine` and a subharness run headless, often many
// at once on one machine and often for a long time, and nobody is waiting on a
// pause there — a resident set four times larger, multiplied by a fan-out, is a
// cost paid to shorten a pause no one can see. Those commands keep the Go
// default. An explicit GOGC still decides for both — this is a default, not a
// policy.
//
// ── AND THE SCHEDULER IS THE SAME BARGAIN IN A DIFFERENT UNIT ───────────────
//
// GOMAXPROCS is the number of Ps the scheduler runs, and the Go runtime spends
// the machine's cores on that number whether or not a surface uses them: an idle
// session's engine host was measured holding ONE runtime GC-worker goroutine PER
// P. On a 20-core machine that was 20 of the process's 33 goroutines; at
// GOMAXPROCS=8 the same process held 8 workers and 21 goroutines, with its OS
// threads falling 13 to 11 (measured Sep 2026, `engine --daemon`, an empty
// workspace, before and after, two runs each side).
//
// A surface draws one conversation and waits on a network, and the parallelism
// that DOES want the whole machine is subprocesses — the tools a session runs,
// each with its own Ps — so the cores above the cap buy a waiting surface
// nothing and cost it a pool of idle runtime workers. Capping at 8 rather than
// lower is measured too: 20->8 removes 12 of the idle goroutines, and 8->4
// removes 4 more while halving what any in-process work may use.
//
// THE CAP HAS TO CROSS A PROCESS BOUNDARY, because a surface's far half is a
// SEPARATE `engine --daemon` this launch starts (enginehost.Spawn from
// chatv3_local.go) — its own process, so it inherits the environment and not
// this process's scheduler, and reads GOMAXPROCS at its own startup. Setting the
// variable is what carries the cap to it.
//
// AN EXPLICIT GOMAXPROCS STILL DECIDES, exactly as an explicit GOGC does just
// below: this is a default, not a policy. And a machine no bigger than the cap
// is left completely alone — not even the variable is set.
//
// ── AND A SOFT LIMIT IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE HEAP BARGAIN ──────────────────
//
// GOMAXPROCS caps a resource the runtime SPENDS. The raised GOGC below uncaps
// one it KEEPS: a heap target five times the live heap is a bargain with no
// ceiling of its own, and a surface left open for a day is exactly the shape
// that finds the ceiling by exhausting the machine instead. debug.SetMemoryLimit
// is the missing half — a SOFT limit over ALL runtime-managed memory, not the
// heap alone, that the collector works to stay under by running continuously
// rather than crossing it.
//
// THE LIMIT IS DERIVED FROM THE SMALLEST REAL BOUND, NOT FROM TASTE.
// [surfaceMemoryLimit] takes HALF of the tightest bound the machine and the
// process's cgroup give, under an absolute floor, and both halves of that are
// there because the failure this must never cause is a limit BELOW the live
// heap: a limit under the working set makes the collector thrash continuously,
// which is a worse failure than the unbounded growth it was added to prevent.
// Half a bound that can run a surface at all is far clear of the roughly 104 MB
// a surface's resident set was measured at, and the floor refuses the small
// machines where half of the bound would not be.
//
// PHYSICAL MEMORY ALONE IS THE WRONG BOUND INSIDE A CONTAINER, which is the
// usual reason to set GOMEMLIMIT at all. The machine's physical memory there is
// the HOST's, so a limit drawn from it lands far above what the process may
// actually use: it never binds, and the kernel OOM-kills instead of the
// collector working. So the cgroup the process runs in is read as well, and the
// SMALLEST finite bound wins. A fixed generous ceiling still loses — one number
// written by hand is wrong on a small machine and a large one at once. And a
// bound that cannot be read (physical memory unreadable, no cgroup files, every
// cgroup file `max`, or the cgroup v1 "no limit" sentinel) is not counted at
// all; if none is readable the surface sets nothing, exactly as it did before
// the cgroup read existed.
//
// AN EXPLICIT GOMEMLIMIT STILL DECIDES, exactly as an explicit GOGC and
// GOMAXPROCS do above — this is a default, not a policy. A machine whose memory
// cannot be read, or whose half would fall under the floor, has NOTHING set
// rather than a dangerous limit. And like the scheduler cap this crosses to the
// engine host as the variable: the child process reads GOMEMLIMIT at its own
// startup.

Examples:

    codeaf do "add a health endpoint and a test for it"

    codeaf logs --tail 20 --model anthropic/claude-opus-4
    codeaf chat --host devbox:~/src/api   the chat here, the work over there

Every command answers ` + "`codeaf <command> --help`" + ` with its own line and its flags.
The environment table is ` + "`codeaf help env`" + ` — every variable and its default.`

// environmentText is the reference half of the old `--help`: every variable a
// person can set, and what it defaults to.
//
// IT IS A VAR AND NOT A CONST FOR ONE REASON: the dollar figures are the real
// defaults, interpolated from the constants that own them
// ([config.DefaultDailyBudgetUSD] and the rest). They were typed out by hand
// once, and every one of them was stale by the time somebody read it — which is
// the one-source-of-truth law's own worked example.
//
// IT KEEPS THE SAME EIGHTY-CELL LAW AS [usageText]. A reference table is the
// one page a person reads with their eyes rather than their memory, and this
// one ran to a hundred and sixteen cells: a variable's name in one column and
// its sentence soft-wrapped back under the name, which is the shape of a table
// that has stopped being one. The name is at column 2 and the sentence at
// column 23, or on the next line at column 23 when the name reaches past it.
const legacyEnvironmentHelp = "AFORGE_* names are read for one release when CODEAF_* is unset or empty." // legacy-name

var environmentText = `codeaf — the environment

Every variable below is read at launch. A variable set here always wins over the
` + "`/settings`" + ` sheet in the chat, and that row reads read-only in the sheet rather
than fighting your shell.

` + legacyEnvironmentHelp + `

  OPENROUTER_API_KEY   a provider key, and the first of three places one is
                       looked for — this, then OPENAI_API_KEY, then the key
                       kept in your profile. Any one of them is enough, so a
                       machine set up in the chat needs no variable at all;
                       ` + "`codeaf doctor`" + ` names the one that answered.
  CODEAF_CODEX_ISSUER  ` + codexauth.DefaultIssuer + ` by default; the sign-in issuer
                       used by ` + "`codeaf connect codex`" + `.
  CODEAF_CODEX_BACKEND the backend used to list models and run codex turns.
                       Default: ` + codexauth.DefaultBackend + `
  CODEAF_MODEL         default ` + config.DefaultModel + `
  CODEAF_PLAN_MODEL    unset: the work model plans too. Set it to run planning,
                       replans, working methods and the delivery gate on a
                       stronger model while a smaller one does the steps;
                       --model and --plan-model do the same per run.
  CODEAF_CHECK_MODEL   unset: a check follows a plan seat pinned by flag or
                       environment, otherwise it uses the crew careful row.
                       Set it to choose the check model independently.
  CODEAF_MODELS        unset: one model, exactly as above. Set it to a panel
                       and calls cascade — cheapest model first, escalating
                       when a verifier catches a failure. Either a
                       comma-separated list of slugs, or a path to a JSON file:
                       CODEAF_MODELS=google/gemma-3-12b-it,~moonshotai/kimi-k2.6
                       CODEAF_MODELS=~/.codeaf/models.json
                       Ratings accumulate in ~/.codeaf/router-ledger.json
                       across runs; see them with ` + "`codeaf models`" + `.
  CODEAF_REASONING     planning calls: model default (unset), off, low, medium,
                       high
  CODEAF_EXEC_REASONING
                       executor calls: model default (unset), off, low, medium,
                       high
  CODEAF_EXEC_TIMEOUT  ` + "`codeaf exec`" + ` only: hard wall when --timeout is not
                       passed, as a duration or a bare number of seconds.
                       CODEAF_EXEC_BUDGET and CODEAF_EXEC_TURNS do the same for
                       --token-budget and --max-turns. A flag that was typed
                       always wins; these exist so a harness can set the walls
                       once for a campaign instead of on every call.

                       after. --max-hours wins.
  CODEAF_MAX_COST      the same ceiling in dollars. --max-cost wins. Either one
                       alone is a budget; without one, --yolo is only the
                       approval posture it has always been.
  CODEAF_PREAUTHORIZE_SPEND
                       1 spends past the day's limit without stopping a

  CODEAF_HOME          the whole state root — journal, workspace, CAS, craft,
                       profiles, catalog, skills (default ~/.codeaf). Move it
                       to run a disposable store that touches nothing of yours.
  CODEAF_NO_UPDATE_CHECK
                       1 skips the launch check; /update and codeaf update
                       still work.
  CODEAF_PROFILE_DIR   where measured behaviour is kept (default CODEAF_HOME)
  CODEAF_CALL_LOG      the model-call log (default <profile>/logs/calls.jsonl).
                       "off" writes nothing; any other value is the file to

                       at a time.
  CODEAF_TELEMETRY    on (default). off turns the anonymous usage counts off;
                       ` + "`codeaf telemetry`" + ` says what they are and what would
                       leave, DO_NOT_TRACK=1 does the same
  CODEAF_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT
                       where the usage counts go
                       (default https://agentfield.ai/api/oss/codeaf/telemetry);
                       set to empty to turn them off entirely
  DO_NOT_TRACK=1     the ecosystem's own opt-out word, honoured as if it were
                       CODEAF_TELEMETRY=off

// section and the run died in one second with `flag provided but not defined:
// - Update the display style property…` and a usage dump. It happened to a real
// benchmark cell and cost the whole run.
//
// A shape cannot answer the question because two different things wear it. What
// answers it is the FLAG SET ITSELF, which is the one authority on which flags
// this command has, and which of them take a value:
//
//   - A token whose name this command declares is a flag, and it consumes the
//     token after it when the flag set says it is not a boolean. That fact used
//     to be a hand-written map at each of the seventeen call sites, which is one
//     source of truth per caller and therefore none.
//   - A token that cannot be a flag NAME is text. Flag names hold no whitespace,
//     so a bullet, a sentence and a multi-line brief are all text no matter what
//     they begin with — decided by structure, never by a list of shapes we have
//     seen briefs take.
//   - Anything else that looks like a flag and is not declared stays in the flag
//     section, so a typo (`-dbb`) is still refused by name rather than being
//     folded silently into the brief.
//

// sections so a positional that begins with a dash reaches Args() intact.
