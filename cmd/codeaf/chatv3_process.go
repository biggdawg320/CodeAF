package main

// chatv3_process.go is what a v3 process owns once and what one conversation
// borrows from it.
//
// The split exists because [openV3Launch] used to be BOTH. Every call loaded the
// model catalog, opened the sub-harness registry, opened the machine's chat
// database and resolved the deliverables index — which was correct while a
// process opened exactly one conversation and is wrong the moment it can open a
// second. Calling it twice would leak stores, repeat the catalog warm, and re-run
// a boot pass that is documented as never repeated.
//
// So there are two objects and the line between them is one question: does the
// answer depend on WHICH DIRECTORY the conversation is about?
//
//   - [v3Process] — no. The profile, the catalog, the harness registry, the
//     memory store, the deliverables index, the accounts manager, the input
//     history file, and where the person was standing when the process started.
//     Built once, in [openV3Process], and handed to every launch.
//   - [v3Launch] — yes. The session folder, the gate, the roles, the spend rail,
//     the context window, and whether this directory keeps a draft or a history
//     at all. Built per workspace, in [openV3Launch].
//
// And on top of both, [v3Seam] — the two closures the surface opens
// conversations through (internal/tui3's Open and Start), which is where the
// per-agent closures are minted so that a conversation and the seams that
// answer for it can never come apart.
