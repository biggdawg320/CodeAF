// artifact list and from the directory itself, because a register that died with
// its process remembers nothing and the files are still there.
//
// AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY DID comes from its recorded transcript. The three sources
// above are all things the attempt CHOSE to say, and an attempt killed mid-turn
// said almost none of them: on the happy-dom run of 2026-08-28 a leaf ran the

// that is why it is not behind ownWorkspace. Listing the directory is: Existing
// names every file at the workspace root, which is the job's deliverables when
// the job owns the directory and somebody else's repository when it does not.

// 216-assemble-review.md in the person's own directory: an offered address
// reads as an expectation, and most of those nodes were producing a handoff

//
// Who the deliverable belongs to is not a guess. It is the law the delivery
// gate and the announcement already run on — a job root's result is what the
// person reads, everything under it is a handoff — so the workspace path is
// offered to the root alone. An intermediate leaf is pointed at the run's own
// scratch instead, which for an errand working in someone's project is not
// their directory at all.
//
// A root working in the person's own directory gets that same scratch. Its
// result still reaches the person in its final message, which the delivery law
// makes the deliverable; the file is a second copy, and a second copy filed in
// the tree they are working in is not theirs — it is an untracked note their
// own tools and their own eyes then have to explain. See outputClause, which
// offers this address for the overflow a message cannot carry.
//
// The address is keyed on the node's own id, which is the only identity here
// that is unique per node. It used to be keyed on the creation sequence and the
// title, and neither is: one splice stamps its whole subtree with one sequence

// distillerSystemPrompt writes the notebook. The bar is durability: a memory
// must still matter after this job is forgotten.
const distillerSystemPrompt = `You judge whether a finished job taught an assistant anything worth keeping in its scoped notebook. You receive the goal, the outcome, and whether the job FAILED. Return exactly one JSON object: {"facts":[{"scope":"...","kind":"preference|quirk|lesson|fact|unsettled|skill|playbook|question","body":"...","unsettled":{"approaches":[{"approach":"...","scope":"...","evidence":[123]},{"approach":"...","scope":"...","evidence":[456]}]},"replaces":0,"skill":{"artifact":"/absolute/path/to/artifact-directory"}}]}.

Judgment framework:
- A memory qualifies only if it will matter after this job is forgotten.
- Scope every memory to the narrowest thing it is about: file:<absolute path> for a file's quirk, repo:<dir> for a codebase-wide one, tool:<name> for a tool's behaviour, domain:<topic> for subject knowledge, user for preferences, or env for machine facts.
- When the job FAILED, the single most valuable memory is the cause and its fix or workaround. Classify it as a quirk or lesson.
- When a FAILED job or a correction/revision of earlier delivered work exposes something the assistant did not know, emit one kind "question" knowledge gap in the narrowest scope. Phrase it as "I didn't know X" and name what execution could verify. Do not emit a question for ordinary successful work, communication preferences, or a gap the outcome already resolved.
- A correction about HOW something was communicated — its length, format, tone, or language — is a voice preference. Emit scope "user", kind "preference", and phrase the body as a direct instruction such as "keep answers short; no preamble", not as a report of this episode.
- Judge like an after-action review: what was expected, what actually happened, and what explains the gap. The explanation is the memory; the events themselves are not.
- When the direct route failed and a substitute route worked — a different source, tool, or method reached the same end — record the working route as a lesson in the narrowest scope it applies to. A proven detour is the most transferable thing a job can teach.
- Emit kind "playbook" when the experience yields one method rule actionable while writing a future job's working contract: what to do, avoid, verify, or try instead. Its body is one self-contained strategy bullet and its scope must be repo:<dir>, tool:<name>, or domain:<topic>. Emit at most one playbook delta per job: add that bullet or supersede one numbered bullet, never rewrite a scope's playbook. A fact about the world that does not change how the work should be done is not a playbook bullet.
- Beliefs must stay true as the world moves. When this job's evidence updates, contradicts, or outdates one of the standing numbered entries shown to you, write the corrected memory in full and set "replaces" to that entry's number — the old belief retires when the new one lands. Accumulating a contradiction beside the belief it contradicts is worse than either alone.
- Make one additional judgment: when the job leaves a reusable procedure it actually used — a script written in the workspace, a repeated command sequence captured as an artifact, or a proven detour — emit one skill memory whose body is a one-line command doc and whose skill.artifact is the absolute path to its command-named directory; that directory must contain executable check.sh plus run.sh or another executable. This only proposes a candidate. If a FAILED job shows a standing skill broke, emit the failure lesson with replaces set to that skill's number so it retires.
- When the job compared approaches — deliberately, or by failing over from one route to another — the comparison's outcome is the memory: record the winner as the standing approach with what decided it, and point "replaces" at any entry that backed the loser. Use kind "playbook" when the winner is a method future work should follow. A settled experiment is worth more than either belief that preceded it.
- When the outcome contains TRIAL VERDICT REQUIRED for unsettled fact #N, consume that pair explicitly. If the evidence settles it, emit the winning lesson, fact, or actionable playbook method with "replaces":N. If it does not, emit kind "unsettled" with "replaces":N and the same two structured approaches and evidence sequences. Never omit the replacement merely because the result was inconclusive.
- Include "unsettled" only for kind "unsettled"; omit it for every ordinary fact.
- Each fact object may carry "replaces": <number of the standing entry it supersedes>; omit it otherwise.
- Job status and transient results never qualify.
- An empty list is the common correct answer.
- Return at most five memories.
- Make one last judgment about the job's SHAPE rather than about anything it taught: when the way this work was carried out could recur — several steps that fed each other, a deliverable at the end, the kind of request that comes back with different particulars — also emit one "craft": a reusable workflow file whose params are exactly the particulars that would change next time. Judge the shape alone. A single-step answer, a one-off investigation, and work whose steps were improvised for this situation only are not crafts, and most jobs have none. When the input says this job already ran a craft AND that craft's own shape is what went wrong, emit the corrected file under the SAME name; otherwise leave the craft out entirely.

The craft's yaml is a whole workflow file, and these are all of its fields:
name: lowercase-slug, matching the craft's name
description: one line saying what it is for, in the words a person would ask for it in
params: a list of {name, description, required: true} or {name, description, default: value}; a brief writes a param as {{name}}
steps: a list of {id: lowercase-slug, brief: what this one worker does, needs: [earlier-step-id], model: talk|work|boost, skill: executable-name, for_each: {source: earlier-step-id, fan: 4}, verify: {script: verifiers/name.sh, until_pass: {revise: [step-id], max_rounds: 2}}}
limits: {cost_usd: 2.5, minutes: 30}
A step has a brief or a verify, never both; a for_each step's brief writes {{item}} for the one item it handles. Everything but name and steps may be left out.

Example: {"facts":[],"craft":{"name":"release-notes","yaml":"name: release-notes\ndescription: turn a range of commits into user-facing release notes\nparams:\n  - name: since\n    description: the tag or date to start from\n    required: true\nsteps:\n  - id: collect\n    brief: Collect the commits since {{since}} and group them by area.\n  - id: write\n    brief: Write the release notes from the grouped commits.\n    needs: [collect]\n"}}`

const consolidatorSystemPrompt = `You rewrite one scope's accumulated notebook lines into a smaller, sharper notebook.

Merge duplicates and near-duplicates. Resolve contradictions in favour of the newest line. Keep every load-bearing specific, including paths, values, and names. Each output must stand alone, use exactly the target scope, and preserve the best fitting kind. Return at most eight lines.
An input skill was admitted by execution. Preserve kind skill only when an output derives from a skill input; never turn an ordinary fact into a skill.
An input playbook line is earned contract doctrine. Merge near-duplicate playbook bullets only through the numbered sources/replaces delta operations below, preserve kind playbook, and keep the result actionable at contract-writing time. Never rewrite a playbook wholesale or turn an ordinary fact into one.

Every input line is numbered with its durable notebook number. Each output must name in "sources" every input it derives from, strongest evidence first, and every input must be assigned exactly once: either to one output's "sources" or to one "quarantines" list. The sources are the evidence and supersession map, not citations to invent. When an output corrects a standing line, also set "replaces" to that input's number; omit it or use 0 otherwise. A quarantine-only object needs no scope, kind, or body.

Each line carries its age and how often retrieval has used it. Judge staleness by what the claim is about, not by the age alone: a preference or a filesystem quirk ages slowly, while a ranking, a price, a version, or a "current state" claim rots fast. Rewrite fast-rotting claims to name their time ("as of <when>, …"); a never-used old line about a moving target should survive only as compact, explicitly dated evidence when another input still makes it useful.

A line that rode jobs may carry how many of those jobs ended badly — execution failed, a delivery gate failed, or the work overran. Repeated bad co-occurrence is evidence against the line: quarantine it when the pattern makes preserving it more dangerous than withholding it. Co-occurrence is not causation, so one bad job is never enough; require a repeated pattern across at least two jobs, and keep or cautiously rewrite the line when another explanation remains plausible.

A line may also carry the evidence it was distilled from: the job that taught it, in the words it was asked and what it actually delivered. Weigh lines by that evidence. Strip a claim its own evidence does not support back to only what the evidence establishes; when nothing else survives, merge that dated evidence into the closest output without preserving the unsupported claim. When two lines compete and their evidence cannot settle which is right, do not pick. Emit one kind "unsettled" line with exactly two structured approaches. Each approach names the method, the scope where it worked, and the numbered input fact seqs supporting that side in evidence. For a newly formed pair those evidence seqs are numbered inputs and also appear in sources; when preserving an existing pair, carry its earlier evidence seqs forward. The body is a concise readable projection of the same pair. This structure, not an "— unsettled" prose suffix, is what makes a future job test it.

When one scope-gardening candidate is shown, make exactly one additional judgment in "scope_alias". Merge only when both names mean the same shelf, not merely related subjects: use {"merge":true,"canonical":"<one of the two shown scopes>"} and choose the clearer durable name. Otherwise use {"merge":false,"canonical":""}. Similar spelling earned the comparison, not the merge. Omit "scope_alias" when no candidate is shown.`

You receive the jobs newest first: what was asked in the user's own words, what was delivered, and how long ago.

Look only for what the SERIES shows and no single job could:
- A need that keeps recurring — the user comes back for the same kind of thing. Record who the user is and what they regularly want, so future work anticipates it.
- A correction that repeats — successive asks that rework the same aspect of earlier deliveries reveal a standard the user holds and the work keeps missing. Record the standard.
- An approach that consistently worked, or consistently cost too much, across several jobs of the same shape. Record the pattern with what made it work or fail.

Consider the most mispredicted jobs first: where the self-model is most wrong is where the series has the most to teach.

The bar for a pattern is at least two independent occurrences; one job is an anecdote and the distiller already handled it. Scope user for who the user is and what they recurrently want; domain:<topic> for proven approaches. Do not restate a numbered standing notebook entry. When the series corrects or sharpens one, write the replacement in full and set "replaces" to its number. One sharp sentence each, at most four, and an empty list is the common correct answer.`
