// ── `codeaf chat --host devbox` ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The surface runs here and the session runs there. This file is the door: it
// parses the destination, starts `ssh <dest> codeaf engine`, completes the
// handshake, and hands the connection to the same surface a local launch opens.
//
// THE PROMPT LAW, and it is the reason this whole path is shaped the way it is:
// EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT ASK THE PERSON A QUESTION HAPPENS BEFORE THE SURFACE
// TAKES THE SCREEN. ssh asks for a passphrase; ssh asks whether an unknown host
// key is really theirs; the engine may answer that it speaks a different version
// of the protocol. All three are plain text on a plain terminal, because they
// arrive while stderr is still the terminal's and tui3.Run has not been called.
// A TUI that came up first would either eat those questions or draw a frame over
// them, and a person would be looking at a hung screen with an invisible
// password prompt behind it.
//
// AND IT IS THE PERSON'S OWN SSH. No library, no key handling, no config file of
// ours: `ssh` is on their path, reads their ~/.ssh/config, knows their aliases
// and their agent. `--host devbox` works because `ssh devbox` already worked.
//
// WHAT THIS DOOR DOES NOT RESOLVE is everything the local door resolves and the
// far machine owns: the API key, the model catalog's credentials, the tool gate,
// the spend rail, the harness registry, the session files. Reading this
// machine's would be assembling a launch that never happens. What stays local is
// what belongs to the SURFACE — the input history, the unsent draft, the model
// picker's cached list — and that is stated once here and once in host.go.

// row for the door to be behind.

// presence reading crossing the wire — a method on the protocol answering
// `Elsewhere` for the engine's machine — and that is a lane of its own with a

		// walked this laptop's `~/.codeaf/v3` and drew eight rows and $22.54 of
		// work under a conversation on a server that had run none of it. The
		// world crosses the wire now (internal/remote's Places.World), and the
		// root it was walked under travels with it so that the conversation this
		// window is sitting in can be put back into a walk taken before it
		// existed (internal/tui3's [app.worldRoot]).
		World:     world.world,
		WorldRoot: welcome.PlacesRoot,
		// AND ONE ROW OF THAT RECORD, WHEN SOMEBODY OPENS ITS CARD. It is a call
		// and not a cache, unlike the world above: the world is asked on every
		// place's open and on the beat, and this is asked once, on a press, about
		// one of four hundred rows. The surface only ever makes it off its loop
		// (internal/tui3's [app.readTaskTail]), so the wire's own deadline is the
		// only clock it needs.
		TaskRecord: client.TaskRecord,

		// left what is held saying the opposite, so the row `ctrl+e` put away sat
		// on the screen until a later beat fetched it back ([hostWorld.archive]
		// carries the whole of why).
		Archive: world.archive,
		// THE AMBIENT SIDE, AS THE ENGINE MACHINE HOLDS IT. The items belong to
		// the machine that runs them, so both halves go over the wire and
		// neither reads a store on this laptop — the far end answers about the
		// far end's own disk, keyed by a workspace path that means something
		// there ([standing.Item.Workspace] is always the engine's own path,
		// which is exactly what welcome.Workspace is too).
		//
		// WHAT THIS LIGHTS UP HERE is both home's item band and the status line's
		// `◦ N standing orders` segment. Home reads the far world, so its project
		// paths are paths this far store can answer, while the segment asks about this
		// window's workspace — which over --host is the engine's own path, so
		// the count is about the right machine ([hostStanding] has the longer
		// version, and internal/tui3's host.go states it in the honesty table).
		//
		// Items therefore answers from a cache and refreshes behind itself,
		// which is not an optimization but the seam's stated law, because that
		// segment is asked on the frame. Save travels synchronously: it is a
		// keystroke, it is rare, and somebody is waiting for its answer.
		Standing: tui3.StandingSeam{
			Items: stands.list,
			Save:  stands.save,

			// Running stays nil; Watch reads the engine's own scheduler over the

			//
			// Running: nothing on the far machine's disk says "firing at this
			// instant" — a run is in flight inside whichever process holds the
			// tick lock — so there is no question to put on the wire and no
			// answer a frame could carry. Nil answers no for everything, and a

			// [v3StandingSeam] declines it for the same reason on this machine's

		// ── WHAT THE CONNECTION ITSELF SAYS ─────────────────────────────────
		//
		// The four facts only a connection has: the sentence to draw while a

		// news a redial discovered, and the questions this conversation raised
		// while nobody was attached.
		// Each lands somewhere different on the screen and internal/tui3's
		// hostlink.go says where; what this door owes is the answer, and the
		// client answers all four.
		//
		// AND IT IS ASSEMBLED THROUGH ONE FUNCTION, because every conversation
		// beside this one has a connection and therefore a seam of its own
		// (chatv3_beside.go's [hostLink]). Two spellings of these seven fields is
		// how the conversation on screen and the conversation behind it would come
		// to disagree about which questions are waiting.
		Link: hostLink(seams),
		// ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT WIRED ──────────────────────────────────
		//
		// These absences belong to --host and --at. The linked-local road uses
		// this builder too, then [localDoors] in chatv3_local.go puts back the
		// stores whose engine and surface are on this same machine.
		//
		// Connections: the accounts panel signs in through a browser HERE and
		// stores the result HERE, while the session reads the store THERE. A
		// panel wired to this machine's manager would offer rows that landed in
		// the wrong place, so none is handed over and /connect says so in one
		// sentence (internal/tui3's host.go).
		//
		// ConnectCodex: the same split for the Codex row — the sign-in's
		// callback listener would be on this loopback and its tokens in this
		// profile, while the session that needs them runs over there. The row
		// says the sign-in is unavailable here, and the terminal door on that
		// machine (`codeaf connect codex`) is the road that works.
		//
		// Harnesses: the registry the engine matches turns against is on the
		// engine's machine. Listing this machine's under /harness would be
		// offering to run harnesses that are not there.
		//
		// SaveApproval and SaveBashApproval: the consent card's "always" writes a
		// row into a profile, and the gate that reads it is the far machine's. Nil
		// is the honest wiring — the card keeps the answer for the session, over
		// the wire, and its row says "allowed" rather than "saved", which is
		// exactly what happened (internal/tui3's consent.go).
		//
		// StandingRoot: the local errand and exchange folder, which is where a
		// question asked from home leaves its short transcript. It is a path on
		// THIS machine and the exchange it hosts is a session this surface would
		// have to open here, so it stays unset over a connection — the same
		// posture the errand pair takes.
		//
		// SaveModel: the same rule for the same reason. The model this session
		// opens on next time is resolved where the session is built, which is over
		// there; writing the choice into THIS machine's profile would change which
		// model a local conversation starts on because somebody switched models on
		// a remote one. The switch itself still takes — it goes over the wire like
		// everything else — it simply does not outlive the session.
		//
		// Sources and ApplyModelSources: the model-service profile belongs to the
		// engine's machine too. A far surface must neither draw this laptop's
		// services nor write one here and claim the engine can use it. The local
		// road hands its resolved set to the surface, while the engine re-reads
		// that same profile through the existing model-set call.
		//
		// AND THE FILE DOOR IS NOT A SEAM HERE EITHER, which is worth saying
		// because it looks like an omission and is not. Remote files — the links
		// in a reply, the browse page /files opens, the fetch behind opening one
		// — ride the CLIENT under this agent: the surface asserts `Client()` on
		// whatever it was handed and gets ListDir, StatPaths and FetchFile off it
		// (internal/tui3's remotefiles.go, on attach.go's narrow-interface
		// pattern). So the door this file already passes is the whole wiring, a
		// local session satisfies none of it and gets none of it, and there is no
		// closure here that could go stale around a conversation that was swapped.

// (internal/tui3's homeRemoteWord), so home's item band and its `p` and `s` keys
// are unreachable here and homestanding.go's per-project standItems is never
// called. The live reader is THE TASK COLUMN'S FOOT AND /status —

// and it asks about the window's own workspace, which over --host is the
// ENGINE's path. That makes the count a true sentence about the right machine,
// and it is a real thing to have: a remote window says how many things are
// keeping an eye on the project it is sitting in.
//
// AND IT EXISTS FOR ONE LAW, which is [tui3.StandingSeam.Items]': it MUST NOT
// BLOCK. That segment is asked on EVERY FRAME and twice per frame while a turn
// runs. The surface already keeps its own three-second answer for it, so this is

// ten seconds per frame.
//

//
//   - THE READ ANSWERS FROM WHAT IS HELD, ALWAYS AND IMMEDIATELY. A place may
//     read on its open and on its beat, and over a connection both of those are
//     still moments a person is waiting through — a call down an ssh pipe has a
//     ten-second deadline (internal/remote's callDeadline), so an open that made
//     one would be a terminal that stopped answering keys for as long as the far
//     machine took, and on a link that had just died, for ten seconds.
//   - ONE FETCH AT A TIME, never a pile. Seven places on a three-second beat,
//     each asking the same question, is a queue of identical frames behind a link
//     that is already slow.
//
// AND IT SAYS WHETHER IT HAS AN ANSWER, which [hostStanding] does not have to.
// An empty list of standing items and no answer yet are the same thing on a
