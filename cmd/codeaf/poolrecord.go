// The Model Pool's judge, wired to the chat door's landings.
//
// When a task lands, a model outside the crew scores each seat the work ran
// on. The scores go into the install's own sheet under the pool directory —
// the one the crew picker already reads beside the index — and, when the
// pool's mode allows sending, into the outbox beside it. The pure halves live
// in internal/pool/judge and internal/pool/record; this file owns the two
// things they cannot: the seam in the engine's landing (session.Config's
// TaskLanded) and the one provider call the judge's questions ride, billed to
// the judge's own seat.
//
// Quiet by design, for poolindex.go's reason: a landing that nobody could
// score is an ordinary state — a pool switched off, a catalog with nothing
// left to pick, a model that did not answer — and nothing the person is
// reading should move for it. Every error here is said only under the debug
// record's switch.
