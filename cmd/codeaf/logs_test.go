// it appends a row for every call these tests make — including the ones that
// deliberately dial a host that does not exist — into the developer's own
// ~/.codeaf/logs/calls.jsonl, where it is noise in the one file somebody is
// reading to debug a real run. The tests below read fixtures instead.
//
// AND THE SAME ARGUMENT IS TRUE OF THE CREDENTIALS AND THE STATE ROOT, which is
// what [isolateTestEnvironment] answers: several doors here are driven end to
// end in the belief that they stop at a missing key, and on a developer's laptop
// they stopped at a live provider instead (testenv_test.go carries the whole
