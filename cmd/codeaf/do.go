// It is deliberately not the plan/run pipeline. That path compiles a graph
// once, writes it to a file, and executes exactly what the file says — which is
// the right shape for inspecting or hand-editing a plan and the wrong shape for
// doing a job, because everything this system learned about doing jobs happens
// after the plan is written: the contract for the kind of work in front of it,
// the gate that asks whether the person would accept this, the round of new
// work a cited gap earns, the replan when a leaf runs out of room. A frozen
// graph cannot do any of that.
//
// So this runs the resident's own brain with the conversation removed. The task
// is journaled as a user command — it is verbatim, and a verbatim ask needs no
// head to close it — and from that command onward every mechanism is the one a
// chat window drives, because it is literally the same construction.

// measured going out over exit 0.
//
// A verdict the system itself overruled is not a rejection — but OVERRULED HAS
// TO MEAN CHECKED AGAINST THE WORLD, and for a while it meant any refusal at
// all. A gap the one polish pass closed delivers whole because the work was
// redone. A gap refused because the file it says is missing is on disk under the
// name the request used, or because the things it says are absent are in the
// text the person is about to read, delivers whole because the finding was
// weighed against the filesystem or against the deliverable and lost. Charging
// either of those a non-zero code would teach a harness to distrust the gate's
// own corrections. That is store.DeliveryGate.Overturned, and it is the only
// refusal that acquits.
//
// EVERY OTHER REFUSAL LEAVES THE FINDING STANDING. A citation refused for its
// provenance — "what the review asked for next is not in the request", "the same
// words were already worked on once" — has been checked against nothing in the
// world. It declines to BUY a round; it settles nothing about whether the work
// landed, because no ruling about where a review got its words makes missing
// work appear. A repair a governor would not fund, or that nothing could plan,
// or that the wall has no room for, is the same shape (store.DeliveryGate.
// Unclosed). So is a mechanical gap: a file the plan itself promised, missing or
// empty on disk, is a fact about the filesystem that no admission rule is
// competent to overturn.
//
// The measured cost of collapsing those into one field is the whole DeepSWE
// sweep: seven of eight graded runs exited 0 — "delivered whole" — with reward
// 0, each of them after its own review had named the missing work and been
// refused on provenance (2026-08-28, bench/deepswe/AUTOPSY.md; the reasoning is
// docs/design/gate/SETTLEMENT.md §2). Before that, one run shipped "Deliverable
// is empty - contains no implementation" over exit 0 for want of the Unclosed
// field, and another produced no file at all and reported settled, done, success
// under a note explaining that the review had overreached
// (2026-08-28, meta/muse-spark-1.1). Exit 2, partial, is the honest code for a
// job that delivered less than it promised.
//
