// saved program — and the code admitted it out loud, in a `longerCommands`
// table whose entire job was to stop `codeaf run --help` printing the wrong
// synopsis (usage.go). The pipeline is `codeaf plan run <plan.json>` now, and
// this door reads its argument to keep both old spellings working for one
// release:
//
//   - a leading `subharness` is the old spelling of this very command;
//   - a first positional SPELLED AS A PATH is the old spelling of `codeaf plan
//     run`, because a plan is a file a person points at and a program is a
//     registry name. The positional is found through the union of both doors'
//     flag sets ([namesAPlanPath]), so `--input in.json` cannot be mistaken
//     for it;
//   - anything else is a program name, which is what `run` means from here on.

// IT IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE WORD AND NEVER ABOUT THE DISK. It used to be
// os.Stat: a first positional that existed as a file took the old road. So a
// saved program called `formatter` executed `./formatter` as a static plan
// whenever a file of that name happened to be sitting in the working
// directory, and WHICH WORKFLOW RAN DEPENDED ON WHERE THE CALLER WAS STANDING
// — the same command, in two directories, meaning two different things. THE
// CALLER'S DIRECTORY NEVER CHANGES WHAT A COMMAND MEANS, so the reading is the
// shape of the token and nothing else ([looksLikeAPath]): a bare word is a
// registry name, and only something a person wrote as a path is a file.
//
// AND THE PATH FORM WINS A TIE. `codeaf run ./formatter` takes the old road
// even where `formatter` is also a saved program, because the caller spelled a
// path on purpose; `codeaf run formatter` is the saved program whatever is on
// disk beside it.
//
// The positional is found the way every other door finds one: by asking A FLAG
// SET which tokens are flags and which of those consume the token after them
