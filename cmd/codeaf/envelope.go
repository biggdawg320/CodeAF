// ONE EXIT LADDER AND ONE RESULT ENVELOPE, for every headless verb this binary
// has: `codeaf do`, `codeaf exec`, and `codeaf run`.
//
// THIS FILE IS THE WHOLE OF BOTH CONTRACTS. It exists because there used to be
// three exit tables, each written where its own command was, and two of them
// said the opposite thing with the same number: `do` exit 1 meant "nothing
// usable came back", `codeaf run` exit 1 meant "it could not be run at
// all", and `exec` returned 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and never returned 1. A script
// that branched across any two of them branched WRONG on at least one, and
// there was no way to read the code and find out which — the tables were three
// separate pieces of prose that had never been put side by side.
//
// The `--json` shapes disagreed the same way. `do` called the answer
// `deliverable` and `exec` called it `text`; `do` reported `seconds` and `exec`
// reported `elapsed_ms`; `do` had `settled` and `exec` had `stop`. A tool that
// parsed one could not parse the other, and nothing anywhere said so.
//
// So: one table below, one builder below, and NO COMMAND WRITES AN EXIT NUMBER
// OR AN ENVELOPE FIELD OF ITS OWN. A verb decides what happened — which is its
// own business and nobody else's — and says it as a [stopReason]. What that
// costs the process, and what a caller reads on stdout, are decided here.

// exitStatus ends the process with a particular code and nothing more said. The
// command has already written its result to the right stream; an "error:" line
// after an honest partial answer would only be noise.
