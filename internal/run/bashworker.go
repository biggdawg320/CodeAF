// BashWorker implements Worker by hosting one session agent on the bash belt
// for one store task. The agent is built the way the session builds a
// bash-belt task worker today ([session.NewBeltWorker], with the task's own id
// as the agent name — the supervisor's claim trick, so the ownership check the
// finish command answers is taken against the exact name the task was claimed
// with); its turn loop runs until the agent ends its turn or the step cap on
// the context is reached, and then a Report comes back.
//
// EVERY STEP IS RECORDED, and the trajectory is the record — nothing in the
// worker's transcript is. A step line is appended when the step finishes, and
// the worker's own ending is one more line, so a person opening the task's
// folder reads the run the way it happened and how it ended.
//
// THE RESUME CLAUSE IS THE ONLY THING PORTED OF CHECKPOINT REPLAY. A worker
// opened on a task whose trajectory already has steps opens with the
// sentence the fresh worker needs — a predecessor was interrupted mid-work,
// and the effects it left are unannounced facts about the tree — and never
// replays a recorded command: the file is a record of what ran, not a
// checkpoint of what to run again.
//
// THE TASK'S SPEND ROW IS WRITTEN HERE, on the model the seat was built on
// ([recordSpend]): the run worker's session has no graph node to charge through
// the ordinary plan-spend path, so this is the one writer of a run task's row,
// and the model it names is the model every call the worker made went out on.
//
// THE FLAG IS THE DOOR'S. The bash belt is what makes a run wire this worker at
// all; the seat's constructor reads the switch once and refuses when
// CODEAF_TASK_BELT names the older belt, so on that road not one byte of any
// prompt, belt or landing changes — nothing constructs this worker.

// OVER WITH NOTHING MOVING UNDER THE WORKER'S OWN TASK BETWEEN THE LOOKS, IS
// A WORKER THAT HAS STOPPED MAKING PROGRESS — and before its task ends there,
// THE BELT SAYS ONCE, IN ITS OWN VOICE, WHAT IT OBSERVED AND WHAT THE WORKER
// CAN DO ([sameStepSpoken]); the ending comes only [sameStepEnd] identical
// steps after the note, whatever the tool and whatever the cause, because
// the ending reads no word of the command and no word of the error: the
// identity of the action, the head of the answer, and the store's own
// record of movement are the whole of the evidence.
//
// THE GAP THE NOTE CLOSES: a worker waiting on something OUTSIDE the plan
// that has not changed yet (a build, a remote job, a deploy) looks with the
// same command, gets the same answer, and nothing under its task moves. That
// is the most common legitimate loop real work has, and before the note
// nothing ever told the worker the law existed: its task ended as not moving
// on a bound it had never heard of. The note says the count, says what a
// changed world does to it, and names the three roads: try something else;
// wait for the outside thing in ONE longer action that returns when it has
// changed instead of many identical looks; or, when the plan names what it
// waits on, park with `plandb wait`. It is the no-action road's precedent
// carried to the mid-turn case: the harness SPEAKS to the worker, in its own
// voice, before it fails it.
//
// The count is over FINISHED STEPS and not model calls, so the words a worker
// says between its actions are nothing to it — and the alternation one action
// plus one text reply, which the no-action ending cannot see because every
// action resets that run to one, is bounded here too. Without this law the
// step cap was the only bound on that shape; a real pair of workers spent 820
// model calls and $4.30 inside it in half an hour, the cause unknown because
// the answer every action got was the same every time. The ending still lands
// far short of the step cap: [sameStepNote] identical steps bring the note,
// [sameStepEnd] more end the task, and a shape that answers the note never
// reaches the ending at all.
//
// THE THREE RESETS ARE WHAT THE LAW DOES NOT END. A different command is a
// different action tried, and it resets everything, the note included, so a
// later run of identical steps is told again; a different answer is a changed
// world, the shape of a worker legitimately waiting on something that
// changes; a move in the worker's own part of the store (its task and the
// rows under it, [movedUnder]) is work it or its children did, read from the
// store's own bookkeeping and never from the command's words. A worker
// whose every look answers differently, or whose own part of the store moves
// between looks, is never ended here — the step cap bounds it as before. WHAT
