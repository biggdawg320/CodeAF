// Package skills discovers agent skills where foreign harnesses keep them.
//
// A skill — as agentskills.io spells it, and as Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and
// Gemini all read it — is a directory holding a SKILL.md whose frontmatter
// names it and describes it. The harnesses that install such folders do so in
// a handful of conventional places, and a person who has already collected
// skills there should not have to copy or reinstall them for codeaf to offer
// them: discovery reads them IN PLACE and reports the original directory, so
// the caller can register the folder itself as the artifact.
//
// The package is pure on purpose. It reads directories the foreign harnesses
// own and writes nothing; it takes the project and home directories as
// arguments rather than resolving them; and it knows nothing about the store —
// what a discovery becomes is the resident's decision. That is what keeps the
// scan testable against fixture trees, and keeps the fact shape another
// surface consumes out of the scan's business.
