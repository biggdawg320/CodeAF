// RootClaudePlugins is the Root every skill read out of a Claude Code plugin
// carries. It is where Claude Code keeps its plugin registry, not a folder
// this scan walks: the skills themselves live wherever each installation's
// own record says it was unpacked.
const RootClaudePlugins = ".claude/plugins"

// MOST OF THE CLAUDE CODE SKILLS A PERSON HAS ARRIVE INSIDE A PLUGIN, and a
// plugin's skills never sit in ~/.claude/skills: Claude Code unpacks each
// installed plugin into a versioned folder of its own and reads the skills out
// of that folder's skills/ directory, or out of the folders the plugin names.
// So this file reads them the way Claude
// Code itself decides which ones are live, and in no other way.
//
// A PLUGIN SKILL IS LIVE ONLY WHEN ITS PLUGIN IS BOTH INSTALLED AND ENABLED.
//
//   - INSTALLED means named in ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json, whose
//     `plugins` map keys each plugin as `name@marketplace` and lists its
//     installations. Each installation carries the absolute `installPath` it
//     was unpacked into and a `scope`: `user` is live in every project, while
//     `project` and `local` are live only in the one `projectPath` they name.
//     An older registry held one object per plugin instead of a list, with no
//     scope, and that shape reads as one user installation.
//   - ENABLED means the `enabledPlugins` map says true for that key, read the
//     way Claude Code layers its settings: ~/.claude/settings.json first, then
//     the project's .claude/settings.json, then its .claude/settings.local.json,
//     each later file overriding the one before. A plugin the map does not name,
//     or names with anything but true, is off.
//
// THE PLUGINS FOLDER IS NEVER WALKED. It holds marketplace clones listing
// plugins nobody installed, and cached older versions of plugins that were
// updated since, and a scan that walked it would offer a person skills their
// own Claude Code does not load. Only the paths the registry names are read.
//
// THE NAME IS THE SKILL'S OWN, AND A PLUGIN SKILL NEVER OUTRANKS A HAND-KEPT
// ONE. Claude Code spells a plugin skill `plugin:skill` so two plugins cannot
// collide, but codeaf's shelf knows a skill by its folder's name — that is the
// one identity every reader keys on (internal/store's Fact.SkillName), and
// the agentskills.io name has no colon in its alphabet. So a plugin skill
// keeps its bare name and settles a collision by rank instead: every skill in
// the six hand-kept folders of a scope owns the name over a plugin's, because
// a skill somebody placed by hand is the one they meant, and between two
// plugins the one whose key sorts first owns it. The loser stays in the result
// marked Shadowed, like every other loser.

// installedPluginsFile and the settings files are named relative to the two
// directories [Discover] is handed.
