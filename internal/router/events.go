// Event is one routed attempt, written as it happened.

// This file is not telemetry for a dashboard; it is the substrate for the
// offline policy work the two labs could only simulate. Both of them had to
// reconstruct what a router *would* have done from an offline matrix, and the
// thing neither could recover was the counterfactual: which models were in the
// running when a choice was made. So the candidates are recorded alongside the
// choice, which is the one field that makes a logged decision analysable after
// the fact rather than merely auditable.

	// Explore marks an attempt the router took to buy evidence rather than
	// because it expected the best answer, and Propensity is the probability it
	// would have. The pair is what makes the log usable for offline policy work:

	// Outcome is the settle's own plain word for how a whole piece of work
	// ended — `landed`, `not accepted`, `stopped` — and it is empty on every
	// row about a single model call. A verdict says what may be LEARNED from an
	// outcome; this says what the outcome WAS, and the two stopped being the
	// same question when the chat engine started grading settled task nodes:

	Outcome string `json:"outcome,omitempty"`
	// Retries is how many times the work was handed back before it settled —

// is landed before a row that would not fit rather than after: a row split
// across two writes is a row another process is free to land inside, and half a
// JSON object is worse in the log than no object. Every write the buffer makes
// therefore carries whole rows only — including a row larger than the buffer,
// which goes straight to the file in one call.
//
// Every read of the file handle happens under the mutex, including the one that
// asks whether there is a file at all. A leaf's settled verdict is appended from
// whichever goroutine reported it, which may be after the run has begun shutting
// down, so Close and Append genuinely do race — the check outside the lock was a
// data race on the handle that only the race detector would ever have shown,
