// Package session is the v3 conversational agent: a working loop
// you talk to, not a dispatcher. It owns one conversation against one
// workspace: the person submits messages, the agent works (read, bash, edit,
// write, grep, find, ls, todo) and streams what it does as events.
//
// The seams are deliberate and narrow. The agent talks to a provider through
// Completer (one method), and to the person through a channel of Events. The
// tasker does not exist here yet: when it attaches, it arrives as extra tools
// (task/change/stop → store.RequestCommand) registered beside the working
// ones, and nothing in this file changes.
//
// The loop's wire behavior — message assembly, stop condition, retry
// schedule, tool parallelism — follows internal/exec/bare, with
// three deliberate differences: it is interactive (Submit between turns, not
// one task to the end), interruptible (Interrupt cancels the in-flight turn
// and keeps the partial), and its compaction follows docs/CHAT-V3.md
// Decision 9 (omp's architecture: threshold = window − max(15%, 16k), keep
// 20k tokens verbatim, one LLM summary with omp's section contract, the pass
// journaled as a transcript marker).

	//
	// EventTaskProposal asks the person whether one groomed piece of work may
	// become a task node (task.go). It carries the proposal in Task: title,
	// the two-or-three-line summary, the full brief, and the auto-approve
	// deadline.
	//
	// It is a QUESTION with a CLOCK, not a report: the propose_task call is
	// blocked until [Agent.ResolveTask] answers it or the deadline passes, and
	// the deadline passing means APPROVED — the surface is the person's chance
	// to redirect, never a gate the work waits on forever. A surface with no
	// answer box for this kind still works: the countdown approves.
	EventTaskProposal
	// EventTaskUpdate reports one task node's progress (task.go): Task carries
	// the state (running, done, failed), the elapsed time, and on completion
	// the report, the changed files, and the merge outcome. It is a report,
	// never a question; the first update (running) arrives as the proposal
	// resolves.
	EventTaskUpdate
	// EventToolAnnounced says one tool call has finished ARRIVING — the model
	// has sent the whole instruction — while the response it rides on is still

	// because those two moments can be seconds apart. A mutating call is
	// announced here and does not begin until the response completes and the
	// batch starts (loop.go's safety law), so a surface that only had
	// EventToolBegin had to choose between drawing nothing for that gap or
	// drawing a spinner for work that had not started. Both are lies; this is
	// the third option.
	//
	// EventToolBegin keeps its exact meaning: EXECUTION STARTED. Every call that
	// is announced is also begun, in the same order, so a surface that ignores
	// this kind is unchanged — and a provider that never announces (a
	// non-streaming endpoint) simply sends no event of this kind.
	EventToolAnnounced
	// EventToolForming says one tool call is still ARRIVING — the model is
	// spelling it out and has not finished. It is the phase BEFORE
	// EventToolAnnounced, and it exists because that gap is not instant: a long
	// write or a groomed propose_task takes seconds to stream, and a surface
	// with only the announcement draws nothing at all for them.
	//
	// It carries CallID (the call's id once the wire has said one), Tool (the
	// name once its delta has landed), Hint (a best-effort gloss built from the
	// argument fields that have CLOSED so far — "write internal/foo.go" while the
	// body of the file is still arriving), ArgsText (the raw partial arguments)
	// and Bytes (how much of them has arrived).
	//
	// NOTHING HERE IS AN INSTRUCTION. ArgsText is half-sent JSON and is never
	// parsed into Args; Hint is a scan, not an unmarshal; and forming NEVER
	// implies execution — a formed call has not been announced, let alone begun,
	// let alone consented to.
	//
	// ORDERING: forming (zero or more, per call) → EventToolAnnounced →
	// EventToolBegin, keyed by CallID. Every call that forms is announced and
	// begun in that order; calls in a parallel batch interleave with each other,
	// but each call's own sequence holds. A non-streaming provider forms nothing,
	// so a surface that ignores this kind is exactly what it was.
	EventToolForming
	// EventGuardianAllowed says a call the policy would have ASKED about ran
	// because the guardian model vouched for it (guardian.go). It carries the
	// Tool, the call's gloss in Hint and Args, and the rule that would have
	// prompted in Rule.
	//
	// It is an ANNOTATION, not a question and not a result: the row it belongs to
	// is the ordinary tool row, and this is the dim line beside it saying who
	// answered instead of the person. A surface that ignores this kind shows a
	// call that simply ran, which is what it did — but a gate that answers on
	// somebody's behalf and says nothing about it is a gate nobody can audit, so
	// the event exists whether or not a given surface draws it.
	EventGuardianAllowed
	// EventNudge says the turn has been caught going in circles (looped.go): Tool
	// is the call that repeated, Count is how many times. A surface renders it as
	// "stuck? nudged · <tool> ×N" for the warning rungs.
	//
	// The first two nudges are notes in the transcript, not errors or refusals.
	// Past that ceiling the same event accompanies the checkpoint take-over rather
	// than a third note. This event is how a person gets to SEE either happen.
	EventNudge
	// EventNotice carries one line in Text about what the turn's own machinery is
	// doing to make the request land — not the model's words, and not a failure.
	//
	// Its one source today is the provider's endpoint-refusal chain
	// (internal/provider's endpoints.go): "Retry 1/3: removed max_tokens",
	// "Retry 3/3: Falling back to <model>". Those retries change the shape of the
	// request a person asked for, so a surface that drew nothing for them would
	// be showing an answer without showing what it cost to get one.
	//
	// It is a NOTE, like EventNudge: dim, one line, never an interruption. It can
	// arrive before any text on the turn, and a turn may end in EventError with
	// several of these already on screen — that sequence is the chain trying
	// everything it had and saying so.
	EventNotice
	// EventConnectAsk asks the person whether one of their accounts may be
	// connected (connect.go). It carries the id the answer is handed back with in
	// ConnectID, and the account in Service and ServiceName — "google" and
	// "Google", the word the tools use and the word a person reads.
	//
	// It is a QUESTION, and the same kind of question a consent prompt is: the
	// use_service call is blocked inside the tool batch until
	// [Agent.ResolveConnect] answers it, the five-minute clock runs out, or the
	// turn's context dies. A surface that ignores this kind leaves the call
	// waiting until one of those three happens, and a clock that runs out is a NO.
	EventConnectAsk
	// EventConnectAuth carries the page the person opens to say yes to the
	// service named in Service: the address is in AuthURL.
	//
	// It is an INSTRUCTION to the surface — open this — and it arrives only after
	// the person has already agreed to connect the account. It is followed by
	// exactly one EventConnectDone, whatever happens next.
	EventConnectAuth
	// EventConnectDone ends one connect attempt for the service in Service:
	// Account is the address it connected as, and Failed says it did not connect
	// at all. The two are exclusive — a failure carries no account — and a
	// person who simply walked away shows up here as a failure, because from
	// this side an attempt nobody finished and an attempt that broke are the same
	// fact: nothing is connected.
	EventConnectDone
	// EventHarnessOffer asks the person whether one sub-harness should take this
	// turn (harness.go). It carries the id the answer is handed back with in ID,
	// the harness's name in Text, and its one-sentence description in Hint.
	//
	// Model is the model the turn NAMED — "research this with opus" — resolved
	// to an id this install has, and empty when nobody said. ModelNote is the
	// other half of that: a word that named no model here, said in words a
	// surface prints as it stands. Neither is a refusal; the offer is the same
	// offer either way.
	//
	// It is a QUESTION, and the quietest kind on this list: the turn is held
	// before its first request until [Agent.ResolveHarness] answers it or the
	// turn's context dies, and NO is free — the turn the person typed runs
	// exactly as it would have. A surface that ignores this kind would leave the
	// turn waiting, which is why the offer is never raised unless somebody has
	// said they are watching (Config.AskConsent).
	EventHarnessOffer
	// EventHarnessRun says the person said yes and the harness named in Text has
	// the turn. Hint is its description, and Model is what it is running on when
	// the turn named one.
	//
	// It is a REPORT, not a question, and it is what a surface draws instead of
	// a model thinking: what follows is the harness's report as ordinary text
	// and then EventTurnDone, or EventError if the run failed.
	EventHarnessRun
	// EventHarnessStep is one step of a running sub-harness, the instant it
	// lands: Step is the walk's own trail entry (subharness.RunWatched) and ID is
	// the run it belongs to — the id EventHarnessRun carried.
	//
	// It is a REPORT and it is DISPLAY-ONLY. A run takes minutes, and between the
	// announcement and the report there was nothing on screen saying which part of
	// it was happening. Nothing here is recorded: the report that follows carries
	// the whole trail (subharness.RunCard), so a step kept in the transcript would
	// be the same news written down twice.
	EventHarnessStep
	// EventHarnessDesign says a turn asked for a sub-harness to be BUILT — "make
	// a harness for triaging flaky tests" — and the design has started
	// (harness_build.go). Text is the goal, less the words that asked for it;
	// Hint is "designing"; Model is what the design is thinking with.
	//
	// TASK NAMES THE NODE IT RUNS AS, and it is the only field on this kind a
	// surface can act on. A design is a task now (harness_task.go): it has an id
	// a person can say out loud, a room they can walk into, and a stop. So the
	// one line this event draws names it — "harness · designing X — task 4" —
	// and everything else about the design's life arrives on the task lane, not
	// this one. Only ID is filled.
	//
	// It is a REPORT and it does not hold the turn: the turn is already over when
	// it arrives, because designing takes a minute and a conversation held on one
	// is a conversation nobody can use. Exactly one of EventHarnessDesignDone or
	// an EventNotice saying why not follows it, on the standing lane
	// ([Agent.HarnessDesigns]) as well as on the turn's stream.
	EventHarnessDesign
	// EventHarnessProgress reports one live snapshot of a harness design call.
	// It is display-only: partial JSON and reasoning never enter the transcript.
	// Goal names the request; Phase is designing or reviewing; Attempt and
	// Attempts size the retry ladder. ThoughtTail is the recent reasoning, Hint
	// is the best meaning recovered from partial JSON, Bytes is content received,
	// and Stalled says no delta has arrived for ten seconds.
	EventHarnessProgress
	// EventHarnessDesignDone carries a finished design in Harness, with the id
	// the answer goes back through in ID, the name in Text and the description in
	// Hint.
	//
	// It is a QUESTION — the only one on this list that outlives the turn that
	// raised it. A surface draws the page (subharness.CardLines is the renderer
	// every surface shares) and answers through [Agent.ResolveHarness], the same
	// method an offer is answered with: TRUE SAVES IT into the registry, false
	// drops it. Nothing is written before that answer, and a surface that ignores
	// this kind saves nothing — which is the same posture EventHarnessOffer
	// keeps, one lane over.
	EventHarnessDesignDone
	// EventHarnessDesignRevising WITHDRAWS a design card the person asked to have
	// changed. ID is the design it is about and Text is the change, in the
	// person's own words as the design's thread passed them on (harness_task.go's
	// revise_design).
	//
	// IT EXISTS BECAUSE A QUESTION CAN BE OVERTAKEN BY A THIRD ANSWER. A design
	// card is one decision behind two doors — the card in the conversation and the
	// approval row in the design's own room — and there is a third thing a person
	// can do with a page, which is to say what is wrong with it. When they do, the
	// page that card is about stops existing, so the card has to come down: left
	// standing it would be a save key over a draft that has been replaced, and the
	// answer it took would save the wrong page.
	//
	// A surface takes the card back to the LIVE form it wore while the page was
	// first being written, because that is what is happening again — the designer
	// is at work, EventHarnessProgress starts arriving, and exactly one
	// EventHarnessDesignDone follows it with the rewritten page. The design's own
	// ROW needs nothing from this kind: the node moves back to the "designing"
	// phase on the task lane, and the approval row is drawn off that phase.
	EventHarnessDesignRevising
	// EventOrchestrateNote carries one planner note from an adaptive run
	// (internal/orchestrate): Text is the note, ID the run. A REPORT; the room
	// draws it as the thin thinking-row between completions.
	EventOrchestrateNote
	// EventOrchestrateFuel is the gauge and its early warning: Text is the
	// spend summary ("$1.60 of $2.00"), Hint holds the cap. A REPORT at the
	// 80% mark and whenever a surface asks; it never blocks anything.
	EventOrchestrateFuel
	// EventOrchestratePause says the run hit its fuel cap: in-flight nodes
	// finished, nothing new launched, the frontier is frozen mid-shape. Text
	// is the spend summary. It is a QUESTION answered through
	// [Agent.ResolveOrchestrate] — top up, finish with what we have, or stop —
	// and until that answer the run sits in its Paused state, resumable.
	EventOrchestratePause
	// EventToolFinished says ONE call's own work is over, the instant it is
	// over, and carries how long that call took in Took.
	//
	// It is a CLOCK EVENT and nothing else: the result is not in it, and the row
	// is not closed by it. The result still arrives as EventToolEnd or
	// EventToolFailed, after the whole batch has finished, in call order — the
	// order the transcript is written in.
	//
	// It exists because those two moments are not the same moment. A batch's
	// calls run together and finish in any order, so a `cd` that took five
	// milliseconds sat under a spinner and a climbing clock until the slowest
	// call beside it returned, and then claimed that whole span as its own
	// duration. The row was reading the BATCH's clock. This is the call's own,
	// measured where it ran (loop.go's executeTool), so a surface can stop the
	// row's clock and state the figure the call actually cost.
	//
	// A surface that ignores this kind is exactly what it was.
	EventToolFinished
	// EventRetrying says THIS STEP IS BEING ASKED AGAIN, and that whatever the
	// dead attempt streamed is void. Text carries the one line explaining why —
	// "nothing came back from the model — asking again", "the reply lost its
	// thread — that text was dropped, asking again".
	//
	// It fires when the stream guard cut a request (internal/provider's
	// streamguard.go): the endpoint went quiet, or the reply stopped being
	// language. It also fires when a transport failure is about to be retried.
	// A rescue taking over a visible answer on another machine serving the same
	// model fires it too (internal/provider's hedge.go).
	// The turn loop discards that attempt's partial text, its early reads and
	// its half-arrived calls before the next request, so A SURFACE MUST THROW
	// AWAY WHAT IT DREW FOR THEM TOO — everything after the last thing the person
	// typed belongs to a response that will never exist, and leaving it on screen
	// would show half a dead answer above the live one.
	//
	// AND IT FIRES WHEN THE STEP MOVES TO ANOTHER MODEL, which is the same news
	// about the same attempt and a different thing to draw: the rest of the reply
	// arrives in a different voice, at a different price. [Event.Retry] is what
	// tells the two apart — its Next names the model being moved to and is empty
	// on an ordinary retry (retrynews.go) — and Text carries the whole sentence
	// either way, so a surface that reads only Text is exactly as correct as it
	// has always been.
	//
	// It is also the one place a surface learns that a wait is a RETRY rather
	// than a first attempt, which is the difference between "waiting for" and
	// "trying again". It never ends a turn: either the next attempt streams, or
	// EventError arrives with the sentence about giving up.
	EventRetrying
	// EventStandingProposal asks the person whether one standing item — a
	// reminder, a watch, a rule, an overnight job — may stand (standing_contract.go).
	// Standing carries the card; the ID inside it is the token a surface hands back
	// to [Agent.ResolveStanding]. Nothing stands until the answer is yes.
	EventStandingProposal
	// EventStandingUpdate reports a standing item changing under a live window: it
	// was ratified, it fired, it was paused, retired, or it needs the person. It is
	// a report, never a question.
	EventStandingUpdate
	// EventSubharnessAsk is a running subharness putting one question to the
	// person (subharness_env.go, the Env's ask() door). ID is the run's task
	// node, Text is the question in the program's own words, and Args carries
	// the answers it offers as a JSON array when it offers a set.
	//
	// It is a QUESTION and it arrives IN THE RUN'S ROOM, which is where the run
	// lives: its journal, its progress and its ✕ are all there already, and a
	// question about the work belongs beside the work. A person who is not in the
	// room learns about it from the ROSTER, because the node moves to the
	// "awaiting your look" phase for exactly as long as the question stands —
	// the same phase a design waiting on its card wears, for the same reason.
	//
	// It is answered through [Agent.AnswerSubharness], which takes the run's id,
	// what they said, and whether they are TAKING OVER. A surface that ignores
	// this kind leaves the run waiting until the node is stopped or the session
	// closes, which is why the question is only ever put where somebody is
	// watching (Config.AskConsent) — an unattended run answers from what the gate
	// declared or stops incomplete, and never guesses.
	EventSubharnessAsk
	// EventSubharnessStep is one host call a running subharness just made
	// (internal/exec's JournalEntry): ID is the run's node and Step carries the
	// entry whole — which door, what it was about, what it cost.
	//
	// It is a REPORT and it is DISPLAY-ONLY, on EventHarnessStep's terms: the
	// journal is the permanent record, this is how a person watches it being
	// written. Nothing here is recorded in any transcript.
	EventSubharnessStep
	// EventSubharnessProposal asks whether one saved program should take this
	// piece of work (tools_subharness.go). ID is the token an answer goes back
	// through, Text is the program's name, Hint is what it is for, and
	// Subharness carries the INTAKE CARD — every input field, what this
	// conversation already answers, and which required blanks are left.
	//
	// It is a QUESTION and it is the one on this list with NO CLOCK THAT
	// APPROVES. A task proposal's countdown ends in a yes because it is a window
	// to redirect ordinary work; this one may not, because a program that ran
	// because nobody answered would be exactly the silent auto-execution the
	// whole path is built to prevent (docs/SUBHARNESS-PRD.md §9). It is answered
	// through [Agent.ResolveSubharness] — true runs it, with the form as the
	// person left it — and a surface that ignores this kind runs nothing at all,
	// which is the correct behaviour rather than a degradation.
	EventSubharnessProposal
	// EventSubharnessProposalOff takes the card named by ID back down. Nothing
	// ran, and nothing about the person's own intentions is being reported: the
	// tool call that raised the card has let the turn go, either because its
	// window expired or because the turn it belonged to was interrupted
	// (tools_subharness.go).
	//
	// IT EXISTS SO THAT A CARD CANNOT OUTLIVE ITS LISTENER. The window is a
	// bound on the TOOL CALL and not a deadline on a person, so it fires while
	// the card is still on somebody's screen — and a card left standing after it
	// would be a `run it` that resolves nothing, silently, which is the one
	// ending a question is never allowed to have. A surface that ignores this
	// kind leaves that dead card up; a surface that draws it takes the card down
	// and says so.

	// EventSteerAccepted says one sentence the person typed INTO the running

	//
	// It is a PROMISE AND NOT AN OUTCOME, which is why exactly one of the two
	// kinds below always follows it on the same stream: the boundary it is

	EventSteerAccepted

	// EventSteerFellThrough says the turn ENDED FIRST — it answered, it faulted,
	// or somebody stopped it — with that sentence still waiting, so no request of
	// that turn ever carried it. The words are not lost and they did not steer
	// anything: they move to the queue that holds a message waiting for a turn of
	// its own, and the stream the steer was sent on carries that turn when it
	// starts (steer.go states the whole law).

	// EventTaskPhase says one running node has moved between its three lives —
	// its worker, the check that reads what the worker left, a repair round
	// closing the gaps the check named (task_audit.go). TaskPhase carries the
	// node's id, the word, the round numbers while a repair runs, and the
	// check's one-line finding.
	//
	// IT RIDES THE TASK LANE beside EventTaskUpdate — the turn's hub AND the
	// standing [Agent.TaskUpdates] subscription — because a check that takes
	// four minutes takes them long after the turn that proposed the work ended.
	//
	// IT IS NEWS AND NEVER A ROW. The node's state does not move: it was
	// running before the check and it is running after it, so a surface folds
	// this into the row an update already gave it and never opens one from it.
	// A surface that ignores this kind is what it was — which is what the
	// evidence in #76 §5 describes: minutes of check and repair drawn as
	// nothing at all, and a person concluding the work hung.
	EventTaskPhase
	// EventTakeover says another window on this machine has asked for this
	// conversation and the turn it was in has ended (takeover.go). It rides the
	// standing task lane and nothing else, and Text carries [TakeoverWord]. The
	// surface that hears it lets go — detaches and closes the conversation the
	// way /new does — and the window that asked resumes it from the checkpoint.
	EventTakeover
	// EventJobUpdate reports one BACKGROUND JOB's life (jobnotice.go): Job
	// carries the job's own id, the short name it has been given, the command,
	// the state, the log path and — once it is over — the exit code. It fires
	// when a job starts, when its name arrives, and when it settles.
	//
	// IT IS ITS OWN KIND BECAUSE A JOB IS ITS OWN THING. A job used to ride
	// EventTaskUpdate as a [TaskNotice], which left every surface downstream
	// carrying a clause saying a job is not really a task — no room, no branch,
	// no price, no stop, no card and no index row. What a job has is an id, a
	// log and an exit code, and none of those is what a task row is drawn from,
	// so it is published as what it is and the clauses go away.
	EventJobUpdate
	// EventCaption carries one line NAMING THE OPEN STEP (caption.go): the
	// cheap narrator asked shortly after the tools begin. Text is the step
	// title — a checklist item, not reasoning. It is news about the open step,
	// never a new block of its own — the surface keys it onto the caption
	// already drawn for that batch.
	//
	// A SURFACE THAT IGNORES THIS KIND IS UNCHANGED: the deterministic
	// composite already stands in the caption slot, and this event only
	// replaces that floor when a cheap model had something better to say.
	//
	// [Event.Category] rides with it and is the same news about the same step:
	// which FAMILY of work the sentence is about (actioncategory.go). It is
	// empty whenever the narrator did not name one, and a surface reads that
	// emptiness as "ask the tools", never as "draw nothing".
	EventCaption
	// EventAssistantDone marks the journal boundary for one valid, non-empty,
	// tool-free assistant response. Its content has already arrived through
	// EventTextDelta and has been recorded before this event is published. It
	// carries no prose of its own: a surface uses it to stop treating those
	// streamed words as provisional while the end-of-turn checks still run.
	//

	// EventMoved says a WINDOW SOMEWHERE ELSE HAS OPENED THIS CONVERSATION and

	// A takeover is asked for on this machine's disk and answered by a window
	// that OWNS the engine: it interrupts, closes, and the work lands paused for
	// the window that asked to resume. A move is announced by an engine that
	// holds the conversation itself (internal/enginehost) to every other surface
	// attached to it: nothing is interrupted and nothing pauses, because the
	// engine goes on running the turn while the surfaces around it change. The
	// window hearing this DETACHES — it does not close.
	//
	// IT RIDES THE STANDING TASK LANE for EventTakeover's reason exactly: it is
	// the one subscription that outlives every turn, and a move happens most
	// often in the middle of one.
	EventMoved
	// EventQuestion carries one whole [Question] in Question: a decision this
	// engine is handing to the person, with its evidence, its answers, the

	// (question.go).
	//
	// IT ARRIVES AFTER THE ROWS IT IS ABOUT, exactly as EventConsentRequest
	// already orders itself against its batch's EventToolBegin rows, and for
	// the same reason: a question attaches to a row a surface has already
	// drawn, and one that arrived first would be a question about nothing.
	//
	// IT IS A SECOND DESCRIPTION AND NEVER A REPLACEMENT. Every lane goes on
	// emitting the event it always emitted — EventConsentRequest,
	// EventTaskProposal, EventStandingProposal and the rest — so a surface that
	// ignores this kind is exactly what it was. A surface that draws it draws
	// one object for every lane instead of thirteen cards.
	//
	// IT RIDES THE TURN IT WAS RAISED IN, AND [Agent.WatchQuestions] BESIDE IT —
	// never the standing TASK lane, which is the roster's and whose readers walk
	// a strict sequence of rows.
	EventQuestion
	// EventQuestionWithdrawn says a question stopped being one: the subject
	// settled, the clock took it, the plan changed, another answer made it
	// moot. Question carries the same object with [Question.Withdrawn] filled
	// in, so a surface has the head it drew and the sentence to retire it with.
	//
	// A QUESTION IS NEVER SIMPLY GONE. A count that drops for no reason a
	// person can see is a count they stop believing, so the reason travels with
	// the withdrawal and is drawn once, dim.
	EventQuestionWithdrawn
	// EventQuestionAnswered carries the whole [Answer] in Answer: what was
	// picked, what was said beside it, who decided and how long it lasts.
	//
	// THIS ONE IS KEPT. It is written to the session's own decisions.jsonl as
	// it is emitted ([Agent.Decisions] reads it back), because it is the
	// DECISION RECORD — the first rung of the ladder, the thing an asker reads
	// before it puts anything to anybody. Consent is deliberately not journaled
	// (a question about work that has not happened yet); an ANSWER is the
	// opposite of that: it is the one thing about a question that stays true
	// afterwards.
	EventQuestionAnswered
	// EventRowNews carries one line in Text about A ROW THE PERSON WROTE that
	// this build has stopped acting on — a pinned machine the router refuses to
	// serve a model from, a base that will not carry a lane choice at all
	// (internal/provider's lanepin.go and prefcarry.go).
	//
	// IT IS NOT [EventNotice] AND THE DIFFERENCE IS WHO THE SENTENCE IS FOR. A
	// notice is the adapter saying what it did to a request to get it accepted,
	// and it is over once the answer lands — a surface may fold it away with
	// the rest of the machinery. This is the only account a person will get of
	// why the machine they named has stopped appearing, and there is nothing to
	// fold it into: it asks them to do something (pin again, or leave it on
	// auto). Measured on 2026-09-13, riding the wrong kind: the pin was
	// retired, `@deepseek` came off the model word, another machine answered,
	// and the chat's work chip had swallowed the sentence that said so.
	//
	// IT IS LAST IN THIS BLOCK AND EVERY NEW KIND BELONGS HERE, because a kind
	// is an integer on the remote wire (internal/remote's EventWire): one added
	// in the middle renumbers every kind under it, and a window and an engine
	// on two builds would then disagree about what each other's events were.

	// ON A CAPTION IT IS THE BATCH'S ANCHOR: the id of the call the batch opened
