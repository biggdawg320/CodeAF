// THE SKILL CATALOG is the one place the conversation is shown the shelf it
// already owns: the skills the distiller has promoted and the resident has
// installed, each named by the command a worker would run and described by the
// line the notebook holds. It is DYNAMIC CONTENT rendered as a section, not a
// session fact — beltfacts.go's facts are sentences about which TOOLS a belt
// carries, and a skill is neither a tool nor a property of the shape: which
// ones exist depends on the notebook, not on the config.
//
// IT IS WINDOWED ON PURPOSE. This section is prepended to every request, so its
// bytes are paid on every round of every turn (prefixbudget_test.go). A person
// whose shelf has grown past a handful of entries must not pay for the tail on
// every call, so the catalog scores the skills against the little context the
// prompt has — the workspace, the project's name, the date — and keeps only the
// few most likely to matter.

	// each turn; eight lines is about the size of the belt-fact sections it sits
	// beside, and anything past it is a roll call rather than a menu. The

	// reads a bounded slice per render.

	// shelf and no `use_skill` has no evidence the shelf is a thing codeaf

//     weaker, fuzzier signal of relevance, so it is a smaller bonus per word.
//   - RECENCY — a skill used more recently is likelier to be the one wanted, so
//     fresh use is a small tie-breaker. Most skills have never been used, and
