// ── The task contract ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This file is the SEAM between the session machinery (task.go — the tool,
// the graph, the executor, the worktree) and any surface that renders a
// proposal. It is deliberately the whole contract: the Event kinds live in
// session.go, and every type a surface needs to answer a proposal or draw a
// node's life is here.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE THING — A DAG, NOT A DEPTH. The destination is a
// dynamically evolving directed acyclic graph of work: a complex task is
// decomposed into nodes with dependency edges, the executor runs the READY
// FRONTIER (every node whose dependencies are done) in parallel, a finished
// node's report becomes part of its dependents' briefs, and a node may itself
// decompose into a child graph. What ships first is the degenerate case — a
// graph of ONE node — but every mechanic is the graph's own: the proposal is
// a node, the countdown is how a node is admitted, the worktree is how a node
// is isolated, the report is what a node hands its dependents. Nothing here
// is a "depth limit": when decomposition arrives it will be edges into this
// same executor, not a new shape.
//
// The chat model grooms a piece of work and calls propose_task with a
// self-contained brief. The person gets a countdown — redirect it, approve
// it, deny it, or let the clock approve it — and an approved node runs as a
// child agent in its own git worktree, reporting back through the same
// steering lane a background job's exit uses. The node's brief is its whole
// world: it never reads this session.

// TaskKind is WHAT SORT of work a node is, and the empty string is the ordinary
// one this whole file is written about: a piece of work handed to a child agent
// in a worktree of its own.
//
// IT IS NOT A STATE AND IT NEVER CHANGES. A node is admitted as one kind and
// settles as that kind; what moves is [TaskState] underneath it. The reason a
// surface needs it at all is that the two kinds are honestly different objects
// to draw — one has a branch, files it changed and a merge, and the other has
// none of those and could never have them — so a card that promised "the branch
// it wrote on is kept" over a design would be pointing at work that does not
// exist.
type TaskKind string

// TaskKindHarness is a subharness being designed (harness_task.go): no
// worktree, no branch, no files, and a page that reaches the registry only if
// the person approves the card at the end of it.
const TaskKindHarness TaskKind = "harness"

// TaskKindSubharness is a subharness RUNNING (subharness_run.go): a saved
// program taking one piece of typed work, with a room, a journal of its host
// calls, and a ✕ — and, like a design, no worktree, no branch and no merge.
//
// IT IS THE ASYMMETRY THIS WAVE CAME TO FIX. Designing a harness has been a task
// since harness_task.go landed; RUNNING one blocked the conversation as a turn
// (harness.go), which made the one thing a person most wants to walk away from
// the one thing they could not. A run is a node now, and everything a node has
// — the row, the room, the id, the stop — it has for free.
const TaskKindSubharness TaskKind = "subharness"

// TaskKindQuick is a task that runs WHERE ITS CALLER WORKS (task_quick.go): the
// caller's own workspace, no worktree, no branch, no merge, no check and no
// landing card. Its last message is its result, and the row goes `done`.
//
// IT IS THE KIND WITH NOTHING UNDER IT, and that is what a surface has to know
// about it. Every other kind of node has something a card can point at — a
// branch coming home, a page waiting on a yes, a program's typed output — and
// this one has an answer and, when it wrote, the files it wrote. A card that
// promised "the branch it wrote on is kept" over a quick node would be pointing
// at work that does not exist, which is exactly what [TaskKind] exists to
// prevent.
const TaskKindQuick TaskKind = "quick"

// TaskKindJob is a piece of BACKGROUND WORK this session started that is not an
// agent at all (jobrow.go): a command running under `bash background:true`, a
// foreground command that reached its bound and was promoted (promote.go), a
// watch, a video render. It has a log file and an exit code, and no worktree, no
// branch, no room and no report anybody wrote.
//
// IT IS ON THE ROSTER BECAUSE OF WHERE WORK SHOWS, NOT BECAUSE IT IS A TASK.
// The law is that work this conversation started shows on the right, whatever
// door started it — and a background job was, until this kind existed, the one
// kind of work with no row anywhere: the registry knew about it, the `jobs` tool
// could list it, and the column beside the conversation stayed empty while a
// nine-minute sweep ran. A person watching that column had no way to tell a
// session that was working from one that had quietly stopped.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS, said plainly, is the same price an adaptive run's rows pay
// (orchestrate.go's family seam): the id on the row names nothing in the task
// graph, so a surface that offers to open a node's room or stop it by id will
// find no node there. A job is read with the `jobs` tool and stopped with
// `jobs kill`, and its row is a row.
const TaskKindJob TaskKind = "job"

// TaskKindAdaptive is a run that PLANS ITSELF as it goes (orchestrate.go): a
// family whose root is a goal and whose children crystallize while the run is
// turning, so the denominator a row could quote is "planned so far" and not a
// number anybody fixed at the start.
//
// IT IS NOT ONE OF [taskSpec.kind]'S ANSWERS, and it cannot be: an adaptive run
// has no [TaskNode] and no spec at all — its three index rows are written
// straight from the family seam ([orchestrateFamily]). It is a TaskKind rather
// than a fourth vocabulary because the one question every surface asks of a
// landed row is "what sort of work was this", and an answer that lived in two
// enums would be two answers.

// ACCEPTANCE AT ALL. It is a property OF THE KIND, so it is declared here beside
// the kinds and read from there by everything that has to know — never restated
// as a comparison at a call site, which is how two spellings of one rule come to
// disagree.
//
// A quick task is the one row today. Nothing checks a quick task — its last
// message is its answer — so its builder leaves deliverable and acceptance EMPTY
// rather than inventing a "DONE WHEN" no reader will ever read
// ([Agent.newQuickSpec], and docs/design/quick-task/DESIGN.md §the judge). Every
// other kind fills one: a design promises a page the person approves
// (harness_task.go), a run promises the answer its program declares
// (subharness_run.go), and ordinary work is groomed into one before it is ever
// proposed. A kind added later answers this question by adding a row here or by
// filling the field, and [TestEveryKindsAcceptanceMatchesWhatItDeclares] walks
// the builders and fails the one that does neither.
