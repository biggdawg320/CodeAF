// facts.go is the SMALL SET OF FACTS A FRAME READS, gathered in one place.
//
// A surface sitting in front of a local agent asks these one at a time and each
// answer costs a lock: the model, the name the conversation gave itself, what
// has been spent, what the conversation weighs, how hard each model is being
// asked to think. That is the right shape at home, where a lock is nanoseconds.
//
// It is the WRONG shape over a connection. `codeaf chat --host devbox` puts an
// ssh pipe between the frame and every one of those questions, and a status
// line that asks five of them is five round trips per repaint — which is the
// defect this file exists to end. A [Facts] is the whole set as ONE value, so
// the engine can hand it over unasked and the surface can read it from memory
// (internal/remote's replica).
//
// NOTHING HERE IS DERIVED AND NOTHING HERE IS CACHED. Every field is copied
// straight off the agent at the moment it is read, which is what makes a Facts
// a photograph rather than a second authority — the engine machine stays the
// authority on every one of these (docs/REMOTE.md, Decision 6) and this is only
// how the picture travels.

// Facts is what a conversation says about itself in one value.
//
// EVERY FIELD IS A FACT A FRAME DRAWS, and nothing else is here: the transcript
// is not (it is large, and it is asked for once), the workspace is not (the
// welcome carries it and it never changes), the standing items are not (they
// live on their own beat). The rule for adding a field is the one that put
// these five here — a frame or a keystroke reads it, so waiting on the wire for
// it is a terminal that has stopped repainting.
type Facts struct {
	// NeedsPerson names an outstanding human decision, including hidden chats.
	NeedsPerson bool `json:"needsPerson,omitempty"`
	// Model is the model the next request will use ([Agent.Model]).
	Model string `json:"model,omitempty"`
	// Title is the name the session gave itself ([Agent.Title]), and empty for
	// a conversation that has not earned one yet.
	Title      string `json:"title,omitempty"`
	ShortTitle string `json:"shortTitle,omitempty"` // Deprecated: accepted for old records; never used as a name.
	// Spent is the session's running total ([Agent.Usage]).
	Spent Usage `json:"spent,omitzero"`
	// ContextTokens is what the conversation weighs right now
	// ([Agent.ContextTokens]).
	ContextTokens int `json:"contextTokens,omitempty"`
	// Reasoning is the level held for each model id anybody has dialled, keyed
	// the way [ReasoningKey] folds an id.
	//
	// IT IS THE WHOLE MAP AND NOT THE ONE LEVEL IN USE, because the question a
	// surface asks is per-model and not per-session: a picker draws a row for a
	// model nobody has switched to and names the level waiting on it, and ctrl+t
	// on that row reads the level back before cycling it. A photograph holding
	// only the current model's level would leave both of those asking over the
	// wire — which is the whole thing this type is here to stop.
	//
	// A model with no level set has NO ENTRY, never an empty one: the agent
	// stores absence as absence, and so does this.
	Reasoning map[string]string `json:"reasoning,omitempty"`
	// Thinking is the RESOLVED rung this conversation's next turn will ask for
	// ([Agent.ResolvedEffort]) — whichever scope decided it, and "" for a
	// conversation asking for no thinking at all, which the emptiness law draws
	// as nothing.
	//
	// IT IS THE RESOLVED RUNG AND NOT THE STORED ONE, because that is the word
	// the dial on the seam draws (internal/tui3's effortchip.go states the law:
	// what the cell says is what will happen). The stored rung is a question
	// asked once, by a person opening the dial, and it goes over the wire as its
	// own call rather than riding a photograph every frame reads.
	//
	// It is spelled `thinking` because that is the word every person-facing
	// surface already uses for this setting — the settings row, the task clause,
	// the dial itself — and a fact named one thing in the protocol and another on
	// the screen is two vocabularies for one ladder.
	Thinking string `json:"thinking,omitempty"`
	// Approval is the RESOLVED posture this conversation's tool gate is
	// standing at ([Agent.ResolvedApprovalPosture]) — ask, guardian, allow or
	// deny, whichever scope decided it, and "" for a session with no gate. It
	// rides the photograph for Thinking's reason: the approvals chip beside the
	// rung is drawn on every frame (internal/tui3's approvalchip.go).
	Approval string `json:"approval,omitempty"`
	// Places is the folders this conversation is about, newest first
	// ([Agent.Places]) — the person's own attachments among them, told apart by
	// [PlaceRef.Arrival].
	//
	// IT RIDES THE PHOTOGRAPH BECAUSE THE FOLDER INDICATOR IS DRAWN ON A FRAME.
	// The surface shows what is attached beside the composer and offers a key to
	// remove one, so the set is asked for at repaint rate — and a reading that
	// went to the engine would make the repaint rate of a terminal a function of
	// a round trip, which is the exact defect internal/remote's replica.go
	// exists to end. It moves once per deliberate act and is a handful of short
	// strings, so it is the cheapest thing on this struct to state unasked.
	//
	// Nil is a conversation about nowhere else, which is nearly all of them.
	Places []PlaceRef `json:"places,omitempty"`
	// Skills is the names a person has put in front of this conversation by
	// hand, in attachment order ([Agent.AttachedSkills]).
	//
	// IT RIDES THE PHOTOGRAPH FOR THE FOLDERS' REASON: the skill chip above the
	// box is drawn on a frame, and the picker marks its rows from the same set
	// after every toggle. It moves once per deliberate act and is a few short
	// names. Nil is nothing attached, which is nearly every conversation.
	Skills []string `json:"skills,omitempty"`

// LevelFor is the reasoning level held for one model id, and "" for a model
