// THE PROFILE IS DERIVED, SETTLED ONCE, AND CHANGES EXACTLY FOUR THINGS.
//
// promptprofile.go is a second shape of fixed prefix rather than a second
// product, so this file asks the two questions that keep it that way: is the
// derivation the one the ruling named (the pin, then the window, and NOTHING
// else — no model name, no vendor, no crew seat), and
// does each of the four doors it opens do what it says and nothing else. The
// frontier arm's own guarantee is next door in prefixbudget_test.go
// ([TestAFrontierShapeIsUntouchedByTheProfile]), where the number that would
// notice a side-effect lives.
