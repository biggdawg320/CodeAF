// ── THE ONLY WAIT A PERSON EXPERIENCES IS THE MAIN MODEL GENERATING ─────────
//
// THAT IS A LAW OF THIS FILE, and it is stated here because it is the one rule
// the turn loop cannot enforce with a type. Everything a turn asks that is not
// the person's own model — the recall that picks which remembered lines this
// message needs, the judge that asks whether a message was work, the reader that
// sketches what is left of a long answer, a title, a caption, a name — is an
// AUXILIARY READING. Every one of them runs BESIDE the work, and a reading may
// only ever INTERRUPT the work; none of them may precede it.
//
// So the two moments this file owns are measured in milliseconds, and there is a
// test that fails the build when they stop being (loop_speed_test.go):
//
//	message → the main request on the wire      ≤ 50 ms
//	tool result → the next request on the wire  ≤ 50 ms
//
// WHAT THAT COST BEFORE IT WAS A LAW. The call census of 2026-09-11 measured the
// pre-turn recall gate at a mean of 4.3 seconds and a maximum of 10.7 over
// sixteen messages, with the person's own model not asked until a reflex machine
// had answered — 1.7s, 2.3s, 3.0s and one of 20.4s at 09:30:45 — and the mark's
// reader at 8.1 seconds between a tool result and the next step, with the next
// request going out two milliseconds after it returned. Neither of those readings
// decided anything on those turns. They were paid for anyway, by the person, in
// front of every message.
//
// AND QUALITY IS KEPT BY APPLYING EVERY DECISION, NEVER BY AWAITING IT. That is
// the half of this law that is easy to lose, so it is spelled as three rules:
//
//   - A decision that arrives before it is spent is applied to THIS step, exactly
//     as it always was.
//   - A decision that arrives late is applied to the NEXT step, or journaled as
//     late with what it would have changed — never silently dropped, because a
//     dropped reading is a reading whose ledger never learns (memory.go's
//     [recallAside], checkpoint.go's [markAside]).
//   - A decision that cannot be applied after the fact must be made cheap enough
//     to precede: at most [lanes.SpokenWithin], and skipped for this step past it.
//
// AND A READING DECIDES WHERE IT USED TO ACT. A reading whose EFFECT fires from
// inside its own goroutine is this mechanism used in name and broken in fact:
// the effect lands whenever the calls under it happen to return rather than at
// the moment the turn could still spend it, and a turn about to be re-opened has
// already had work started over the top of it. So every reading answers a value
// and the turn is what acts on it (route_judge.go's [judgeRuling] is the one
// that had to be taken apart to say so).
//
// THERE IS EXACTLY ONE EXCEPTION AND IT IS NAMED. The guardian — "is this one
// tool call plainly safe to run without asking" (consent.go) — decides whether a
// tool RUNS, so there is nothing to run beside it and nothing it can be applied
// to afterwards. It keeps its full ten-second window, and what it owes the person
// instead is a phase word for the whole of it, because a wait that is real is
// reported (docs/design/waiting/DESIGN.md).
//
// THE LAW IS ALSO TRUE READ FROM THE OTHER END: NOTHING THE TURN *TELLS* MAY
// HOLD IT UP EITHER. A reading is something a turn asks for; a phase is
// something it says, and for as long as saying one was a straight call into the
// surface's reader, the last act of every model call waited out a whole Bubble
// Tea draw on this goroutine — because internal/tui3 asks for its frame down an
// unbuffered channel. News is left on a desk now and the teller walks away
// (sidecar.go's [desk], phasenews.go, lanenews.go), which is the same law with
// the producer and the consumer swapped.
//
// AND THE END OF A TURN IS A DIFFERENT WAIT FROM THIS ONE. Once the model has
// stopped writing there is no work left to run beside, so the two readers that
// decide whether the answer finished the ask and whether it should have been work
// are RACED AGAINST EACH OTHER rather than taken in series, and the phase clock
// says which of them is holding the turn open.

// the request never failed, so there is nothing here to back off from, and the
// same four attempts that make sense for a socket would keep a model that has
// lost the thread going four times over a context that is only getting worse.
//
// THE NUMBERS ARE NOT HERE ANY MORE, and that is the point of the change they
// moved in. They are [taxonomy.SilentCutAttempts] and its two neighbours, read
// by the one policy that decides what any failed request is worth
// (internal/taxonomy's transportBudget), so that a cut and a refusal are one
// story told from one place rather than two budgets kept in two files that
// answered "is there another model to ask" differently.

	// mid-turn escalation and the belt carries propose_task, and a measured chat
	// message with four independent pieces of work in it was still ground out
	// inline over ninety tool rounds, twice: a model deep in tool momentum does
	// not stop to reach for a verb it rarely uses. So the decision is made at this
	// seam, where it is the harness's to make.
	//
	// AND IT IS ASKED WITHOUT STOPPING ANYTHING, which is the difference between
	// this line and the one above it. It used to hold the turn against a deadline
	// shorter than the judge's own floor latency, so it answered nothing and cost
	// every message the wait; now it RACES the turn and the loop simply carries the
	// handle. A no is free because nobody ever waits for it, and the turn below
	// runs exactly as it did before this existed.

	// is a verdict nobody may spend — the post-turn judge has already read that
	// turn, and a task starting on top of a finished answer is the surprise this
	// whole road is built to avoid — so the end of the turn, by any of its exits,
	// is the end of the question too.
	defer race.end()

	// AND THOSE TWO ARE THE ONLY QUESTIONS ASKED HERE. A turn used to be able to
	// be a request for an ADAPTIVE RUN — the planned graph of nodes in
	// orchestrate.go — read off an anchored cue at the head of what somebody
	// typed, and that cue was routed from exactly here. IT IS GONE, AND NO CHAT DOOR REACHES THE PLANNED DAG
	// ANY MORE. Somebody who types `orchestrate the migration` gets an ordinary
	// turn: the model answers it, and if it reads as work the route judge starts
	// a task on the one road every other piece of work takes (route_judge.go).
	// That is ABSENCE AND NOT REFUSAL — nothing special-cases those words,
	// nothing says no to them, and there is no phrasing that gets a run instead.
	//
	// THE ENGINE ITSELF IS UNTOUCHED, and its chat-side wiring is kept
	// deliberately rather than ripped out: [Agent.RunOrchestrate], the roster
	// family, the fuel gate, the snapshot and steering seams a run's page is
	// drawn from, and [Config.OrchestrateRunner] all stand. What drives
	// internal/orchestrate today is cmd/harness-design, on a driver of its own.
	// A saved program from /subharness is NOT a run — it is a task node started
	// by its own runner (subharness_contract.go) — so nothing in a conversation
	// enters that package by any road. The pieces of orchestrate.go that no chat
	// door reaches any more say so where they stand.

	// which of the things this person has had codeaf remember bear on what they
	// just said (memory.go).
	//
	// IT IS NOT A LINE OF THIS FUNCTION ANY MORE. It is already in flight — it was
	// started beside the title, at the one place a turn begins
	// ([Agent.startRecallLocked]) — and what happens here is that the turn picks
	// up the handle and carries it. This is the file's own law in the one place it
	// was most expensively broken: the call census of 2026-09-11 measured the main
	// model not being asked until a mistral-nemo call returned, on every single
	// message.
	//
	// Everything about it still fails open — an empty block is a turn exactly as
	// it would have been — and everything it finds is still applied: to this
	// request if it is back before the first token, to the next step if it is not.

	// AND WHAT THE OTHER WINDOWS ON THIS PROJECT HAVE BEEN DOING (taskdelta.go),
	// beside the work for the same law. It makes no model call — it opens the
	// project index and one small JSON per live window — but a shared directory on
	// a cold disk is still a wait, and the only wait a person experiences here is
	// the model generating. It fails open the same way: no folder, no index and no
	// other window each answer an empty block, and a turn with an empty block is a
	// turn as it always was; a read that lands after the first request rides the
	// next step, which is the same bargain the recall takes.
	//
	// IT GOES THROUGH [readBeside] AND NOT THROUGH A `go` OF ITS OWN, which is
	// sidecar.go's whole reason for existing: a reading with its own goroutine has
	// its own idea of what a cancellation means, and this one had none at all —
	// it was measured stamping a conversation's folder after that conversation
	// had closed. Nothing takes its answer, because its answer IS the assignment
	// it makes; what the door buys is the cancellation — the reading carries the
	// context it is given and obeys it ([Agent.refreshElsewhere]) — and a reading
	// the beside-watch can see, so a fixture waits on the fact instead of guessing.
	//
	// AND A TURN THAT MAY NOT BE TOLD STARTS NO READING AT ALL. A task node and a
	// conversation with no folder are both answered by one predicate
	// ([Agent.tellsElsewhere]); asking it here keeps a reading that would return

	// which had said nothing, sent the whole prompt a second time. The transport
	// now has a better answer to the same question (internal/provider's hedge.go
	// over internal/lane's watch.go) — it derives the wait from the serving
	// lane's own posterior instead of a constant, sends the second request to a
	// NAMED alternative lane rather than back into the same pool, spends it out
	// of a process-wide budget, cancels the loser and folds both arms back into
	// the ledger, and it acts on a reasoning stall as well as on silence. Two
	// mechanisms racing one silence is two bills for one answer and two stories
	// on one status line, so the blind one was retired.

	// WHO IS WAITING ON THIS TURN. A conversation's turn is a person watching an
	// answer arrive, and the endpoint that starts soonest is what they are asking
	// for. A TASK NODE's turn is the same machinery with nobody in front of it —
	// a whole conversation, hub and observer and room, running while the person
	// is somewhere else — and speed is worth nothing to it. It routes by price
	// instead (internal/provider's velocity.go), which is the only thing said
	// here: an explicit routing row still wins over both.
	//
	// AND WHAT THAT WAIT IS WORTH, in the unit the lane chooser trades in: λ,
	// seconds per dollar (internal/lane's Lambda). Who is waiting and what their
	// waiting costs are two different facts and the router needs both — the
	// first decides whether to ask for speed at all, the second decides how much
	// a second of it may cost. A turn is worth a person's attention; it is said
	// rather than inferred for the reason WithRoutingIntent is said rather than
	// inferred.
	//
	// A TASK NODE'S λ IS NOT ZERO WHEN SOMEBODY IS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE RUN.
	// It was, on every task turn this build ever ran, and the simulator priced
	// what that bought: a fifth off the money for nearly four times the wait
	// (bench/lanelab/REPORT.md, "the λ = 0 row"). λ = 0 is the statement that a
	// second is worth NOTHING, and it is only true of work whose owner is not
	// there — a run started from a window somebody is watching has an owner
	// reading its cards as they land, and the seconds are theirs.
	//
	// THIS IS THE V1 RULE AND THE SIGNATURE SAYS SO. [lane.Lambda] takes the
	// slack, the expected duration and the deadline the plan DAG will one day
	// supply, and until it does they are zero here and the answer comes off the
	// first argument alone: attended work is worth a person's attention,
	// unattended work is worth nothing.
	//
	// AND THE INTENT NOW FOLLOWS THAT RULE INSTEAD OF SITTING BESIDE IT. It used
	// to be background for every node whatever was on the screen, on the grounds
	// that nobody reads a node's raw stream — which left the two halves of one
	// fact free to disagree, the λ saying a watched node's seconds belong to
	// somebody and the intent saying they belong to nobody. They are one stamp
	// now: the turn names its ROLE and internal/lane's table answers both, so an
	// unwatched node's seconds are worth nothing and the seconds of a node whose
	// run somebody is sitting in front of are worth what theirs are.
	//
	// AND ALL OF IT SAID ONCE, AS A ROLE. internal/lane's roles.go holds the
	// table — what a second of this errand's wait is worth, what quality bar it
	// needs, how many calls it will make, and whether a person is reading THIS
	// stream — and the role is the only thing a call site names. The intent
	// below is kept beside it because what a wait is worth is still read off it
	// and a dozen other packages still set it, but it is now a READING of the
	// role rather than a second opinion about the same fact (internal/provider's
	// roles.go).

// ── THE ENDPOINT-DIVERSITY GATE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A model hop is a big move — it changes whose weights finish a reply somebody
// is reading — and it is only honest AFTER the cheaper explanation has been
// ruled out. The cheaper explanation is almost always the endpoint: a router
// serves one model id from a pool, and a single bad member of that pool can
// swallow three attempts in a row.
//
// That is exactly what the layer underneath now prevents. A cut whose stream
// named its provider strikes that (model, endpoint) lane out of the velocity
// ledger, so the next attempt is encoded away from it — endpoint diversity, got
// for free, before this ever asks about models. By the time a full budget of
// cuts is spent, several different endpoints have failed and the model itself is
// the remaining suspect.
//
// UNLESS NOTHING WAS STRUCK, which is [provider.StreamCut.Rerouted] being false
// and has two causes that look identical from here and want the same answer:
//
//   - `routing = off`: the person has told the adapter not to steer, so the
//     ledger is silent by their own instruction. Nothing is being routed around.
//   - an ANONYMOUS cut: the stream died before any chunk named the endpoint that
//     served it, so there was no lane to strike.
//
// In both, the next attempt is drawn from the same pool by the same rules and
// lands on the same lane deterministically — so the extra attempts buy nothing,
// and spending a person's wait on them to look thorough is dishonest. The
// budget narrows to [blindRetries] and the hop comes sooner.
//
// `routing = off` therefore does NOT switch model hops off. It switches ENDPOINT
// steering off, which is a different promise; the two knobs that do switch hops
// off are an empty chain and `--one-model`, and both make the hop ABSENT rather
// than broken.

// Degeneration is the one thing the gate says nothing about: soup is a claim
// about the transcript and the weights reading it, never about which endpoint
// delivered it, so it keeps its own short allowance either way. A machinery leak
// shares that allowance for the same reason — the answer came back wrong-shaped,
// and asking the same lane again returns the same shape ([degenerateCut]).
//
// AN OVERRUN IS AN ENDPOINT CLAIM and shares the silence allowance deliberately.
// A reply that ran past the wall its own lane earned is that lane failing to
// finish, exactly as a reply that went quiet is — the ledger struck it either
// way (internal/provider's noteCutProvider) — so the question "did anything
// actually move" governs both.

// nextFallback is the model this step moves to next, and false when there is
// none left — an empty chain, a completer with no chain to offer, or a chain
// already walked to its end.
//
// The order and the cap are NOT decided here. They are the adapter's, read
// through [modelChain], so the models a refusal falls back to and the models a
// stall falls back to are the same models in the same order.

// fail — a socket that dies at the last chunk, a 502 between two deltas — and
// that failure is RETRYABLE: completeWithRetry re-sends the same transcript and
// the model issues the batch again. A write or a bash that had already run would
// then run a SECOND time, on nobody's instruction, with the first run recorded
// nowhere. There is no bookkeeping that fixes this, because the loop cannot know
// whether the first run's effects are still there.
//
// A READ-ONLY CALL IS IDEMPOTENT, so the same retry costs only the work: reading
// a file twice returns the file twice and changes nothing about the world or the
// transcript. That asymmetry — not speed, not the tool's cost — is the entire
// reason the two sets are treated differently, and it is why membership here is
// enumerated rather than inferred from a flag a tool could set about itself.
//
// The names are the belt's four readers (bare/tools.go). Anything not named
// here — write, edit, bash, a tool the workforce adds later, a tool a test
// appends — waits for the response to complete, exactly as before this existed.

// ── THE PRE-ACTION CHOKEPOINT ──
//
// The `pre-action` hook (hooks.go) is here, and here only — the consent gate
// (consent.go) with the guardian inside it (guardian.go), and the ledger that
// notes what a mutating call is about to change (recovery.go). This is the one
// function every execution passes through: the batch runs its calls through it
// (runToolsWarm), and so does the early start that begins a read while the
// response is still streaming (warmBatch.consider). A gate wrapped around the
// belt's tools instead would be the same check written once per tool — a tool
// appended later, by the workforce or by a test, would carry no gate and
// nothing would say so — and a gate in runToolsWarm alone would leave the early
// path ungoverned, which is exactly the path that runs without the person
// having seen the call yet.
//
// The episode is a required argument for the same reason: a new call site
// cannot reach a tool without one, so it cannot reach a tool without the plane.
//
// `rendered` is [argsText] of this same call, HANDED IN RATHER THAN COMPUTED,
// because the caller has already rendered it for the events it sends about the
// call and the three must carry identical bytes (runToolsWarm says why). A call
// site with nothing in hand renders it itself; there is no path that may pass
// something else.
//
// It sits INSIDE the dispatch loop rather than above it, after the belt has
// been found to carry the tool: a call for a tool that does not exist is
// answered "Unknown tool", never asked about. A question about a tool nobody
// has is a question with no right answer.
// AND IT IS WHERE THE DEBUG RECORD LEARNS ABOUT TOOLS. Everything a call can
// become — it ran, it failed, a door refused it before it ran, the hand was not
// on the belt at all — comes back through this one function, so the record is
// written around it rather than inside the four exits below (debugrecord.go).

//     work is replaced by one marker line naming how much went and where it can
//     be read, and the fold runs down to [compactTarget] — below the threshold
