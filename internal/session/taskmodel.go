// WHICH MODEL A TASK RUNS ON, AND WHO DECIDES.
//
// A node is the same worker doing the same job somewhere quieter (task_run.go),
// so it inherits the conversation's model and that is the right default for
// almost every piece of work. What this file adds is the OTHER case: the person
// says "let opus do this one" or "use something cheap for the sweep", and the
// model that grooms the work is the one holding both halves of that sentence —
// what the work is, and what they asked for. So `model` is an argument on
// propose_task, resolved HERE against the models this install actually has.
//
// ── THREE ANSWERS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS AN ERROR ──
//
//   - ONE MATCH IS THE ANSWER. "opus-5", "anthropic/claude-opus-5" and a
//     vendorless tail that only one row carries are all the same decision, and
//     none of them is worth asking a person about.
//   - MORE THAN ONE IS A QUESTION, not a guess. The shortlist rides on the
//     proposal the person is already being shown (task.go), because a task that
//     is about to start on a model nobody named is the one moment the choice is
//     cheap to correct.
//   - NOTHING IS A REFUSAL THE MODEL CAN ACT ON: an ordinary tool result naming
//     the nearest ids, so a wrong guess costs one round trip rather than a task
//     started on a model that does not exist. A word that matches half the
//     catalog is the same refusal for the same reason — a shortlist of eleven is
//     a list, not a choice.
//
// ── WHY THE MATCHING LIVES HERE AND THE CATALOG DOES NOT ──
//
// This package holds no catalog and must not: which models a person has is the
// surface's fact, resolved from settings and a provider listing, and it changes
// while the session runs. [Config.TaskModels] is the seam, exactly as
// SupportsImages and NearestModels are, and NIL IS "NOBODY CAN SAY" rather than
// "there are none — a caller that hands over no list gets the word taken as
// written and the provider's own error if it is wrong, which is what every
// caller had before this file existed.
