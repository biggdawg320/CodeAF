# Where you look: places, panels, and commands

## Three places

codeaf has three, and only three, top-level places. Switch with the header, or:

- **thread** — `alt+1` — the conversation, receipts, and results
- **board** — `alt+2` — live jobs and running services
- **self** — `alt+3` — everything codeaf does when you are not asking

`‹` and `esc` walk back out of whatever is layered on top.

## Self

Self opens as one calm list, the way a settings app does. The top line is
today — what it cost, what it learned, how long it practised — and under it one
row per thing codeaf does on its own. Each row says how many there are and, in
its own words, what they are:

| row | what it holds |
| --- | --- |
| **Crafts** | job-shapes it learned — versioned, measured, reusable |
| **Competence** | where it is strong and where it is at its frontier, measured |
| **Beliefs** | the notebook: what it holds true about you and this machine |
| **Skills** | procedures it forged and verified; they ride every worker's PATH |
| **Watches** | standing goals checking on their own schedule |
| **Services** | processes it keeps alive for you |
| **Practice** | what it did with idle time, and what that taught it |
| **Dials** | how it balances demand against curiosity — read-only, edit in `⚙` |

A row with nothing in it still explains itself, so you learn what would go
there before anything does.

`↑/↓` or `j/k` move, enter (or a click) drills in, `esc` walks back out one
rung at a time — filter, then item, then list, then the place. Inside a
drill-in the letters belong to the filter: **type to search**. Every list shows
a window rather than everything — `214 · showing 20` — with `show 20 more`
under it, and anything older than a week folds behind `N older · type to
search` so a brain that has been running for months still opens instantly.

Opening a craft shows its steps, the bounds a run will obey, and its version
history — the same commits `git log` shows in the craft directory. Opening a
watch or a service hands you to its card on the board, which is the one place
that can act on them.

**Practice** groups repeated attempts at the same goal into one row —
`the goal, clipped · ×6 · $0.67 · nothing yet` — with the count and the cost in
their own aligned columns. Open a row to see the whole goal and every attempt
behind it: when it ran, what it cost, and what it came back with.

## The task rail and drilling into a worker

`ctrl+t` (or `alt+g`) toggles the task rail beside the thread. `[` and `]` nudge
the split. `↑/↓` or `j/k` move the selection, enter opens what is selected, and
`tab` cycles the zones: input, questions, thread, rail, header.

Opening a task turns the input into a **steer** box — the placeholder changes to
*"steer this worker — lands before its next turn"*. Type there and your line
reaches that worker between turns, without re-planning anything. Steered lines
appear in the feed prefixed `steered:`. With the keyboard on the feed, `c` cancels the
worker you are looking at — `tab` moves the keyboard between that box and the
activity feed, and the single-key actions belong to the feed, so nothing you
type into a steer line can act on the job. Close it and your chat draft comes
back exactly as it was.

## Voice

`ctrl+v` (or `alt+v`), or click the mic. Speak; a live transcript appears while
you talk, and a full pass runs when you stop. The result is merged into your
draft — it is never sent for you. `esc` discards it. If the microphone is not
available you are told so, and your draft is kept.

## Answering questions

A pending question sits above the input. With an empty draft, `1`–`9` or the
arrow keys choose an option and enter sends it. You can always type a free-text
answer instead of picking. `esc` dismisses it.

## Settings

Everything you can tune lives in one sheet. Open it with `/settings`, the
`⚙` in the header, or `alt+,` — a bare `,` works too whenever the
cursor is not in the input. It is a single column of grouped rows: **models**
(all eight slots, plus the Model Pool row — `on` reads and sends, `read`
uses the pool and sends nothing, `off` does neither), **money & limits**
(the daily budget, the practice
carve-out, the quiet period before practice), **rhythm** (how long an absence
earns an arrival brief, how many clean firings earn a charter tenure),
**learning** (how much practice follows measured demand rather than curiosity,
and whether codeaf may propose new skills), **documents & vision** (the reading
rung and the model that looks at images), **sharing** (attribution.model — whether
the line codeaf always signs its commits with names the model), and
**appearance** (the chat/rail split).

`↑/↓` or `j/k` move, enter changes the focused row, `esc` closes an open editor
and then the sheet. Only the focused row explains itself, so the page never
becomes a wall. A model row opens the same capability-filtered picker the
models door opens. Nothing is posted to the thread when you change something —
the row showing its new value is the receipt.

Anything pinned in your environment stays pinned: that row reads dim, says
`pinned by CODEAF_…`, and refuses to be edited rather than writing a value the
shell would keep overriding. The footer lists the operator plumbing that is
set — base URL, profile directory, panel, reasoning — read-only, because those
are the machine's settings, not yours.

## Keys worth knowing

| key | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ctrl+j` | newline without sending |
| `ctrl+b` / `alt+b` | cycle boost: armed → pinned → off |
| `ctrl+v` / `alt+v` | voice input |
| `ctrl+t` / `alt+g` | toggle the task rail |
| `alt+1` / `alt+2` / `alt+3` | thread / board / self |
| `alt+,` / `,` | open the settings sheet |
| `v` | expand or collapse reading receipts |
| `y` / `Y` | copy the focused answer / the file it produced |
| `?` | this guide's surface-level twin, when the draft is empty |
| `esc` | back out one layer at a time, then quit |
| `ctrl+c` | quit immediately |

## Slash commands

Type `/` and filter. The full set:

`/graph` `/self` `/tasks` `/node` `/open` `/notebook` `/history` `/budget`
`/standing` `/settings` `/help` `/model` `/memory` `/session` `/new` `/cancel`
`/quit`

`?` opens the same catalogue as a scrollable overlay, generated from that same
list, so the two can never disagree.

## Getting work out

A deliverable's path is printed in full and rendered as a link your terminal can
open. Beyond that: `y` copies the focused answer, `Y` copies the file it
produced, and `/open` hands that file to your machine's own opener. The copy
goes through the terminal's clipboard, so it works the same over ssh as it does
locally.

## From a shell, without the chat

- `codeaf` — open the resident chat. A second instance opens as a read-only
  visitor rather than fighting over the same brain.
- `codeaf do "<task>"` — one errand, start to finish, with nobody watching. It
  is the same brain the chat runs with the conversation removed: the same
  planning, the same contracts, the same delivery gate, the same repair when a
  gap is found. It works in the directory you are standing in and edits what is
  there. The exit code is the verdict — 0 worked, 1 did not, 2 hit the wall with
  partial work — so a script can believe it. What it prints is the answer, then
  a short footer: the files the run wrote, one absolute path per line under
  `files:`, anything workers told each other under `learned:`, and the elapsed
  time, node count and cost. `--json` prints that same outcome as one object on
  stdout instead, with the files under `artifacts`. Both lists are the files the
  run actually produced, not every path it mentioned. It is a one-shot and
  schedules nothing for later: an errand never practices, whatever store it is
  pointed at with `--db`. Without `--db` it works in a private store of its
  own under `runs/` in the state root — `~/.codeaf/runs/`, or wherever
  `CODEAF_HOME` points, never the machine's temporary directory. It is deleted
  when the run leaves with 0 and **kept when it does not**, including a run you
  stop with Ctrl+C: the last line on the error stream is `record kept at
  <path>`, and that directory holds the whole record as `graph.db`. `--keep`
  keeps it whatever happened, and so does `CODEAF_DEBUG` set to anything but
  `0`, `false` or `off`. It runs on a crew picked for the run — with any `/crew pin` this profile holds —
  unless `--model`, `--plan-model` or the matching variables pin a seat for it, and it
  opens by saying which of those chose its models.
- `codeaf wake` — run one bounded pass and exit. This is what the standing watch
  timer runs; you can run it by hand too.
- `codeaf doctor` — the brain's path and size, whether a resident is alive, the
  standing watch, today's spend against the rail, active charters, and pending
  questions.
- `codeaf notebook` / `notebook retract <seq>` / `notebook restore <seq>`
- `codeaf competence` — the measured competence map
- `codeaf services` / `services stop <name>`
- `codeaf models` — the router ledger: ratings and how many observations back
  each one
- `codeaf why self` — today's self-spend, itemized
- `codeaf why <node-id>` — what one piece of work actually did: its turns, the
  tools it called with what arguments, what came back, how long each took, and
  how it ended. It answers from the record the worker wrote while it ran, so it
  still answers after the job's working directory is gone. A node whose worker
  keeps no record says so rather than printing nothing.
- `codeaf plan new "<goal>"`, `codeaf plan show`, `codeaf plan revise`,
  `codeaf plan run` — the static pipeline: build a plan to a file, read it,
  re-plan it from what happened, execute exactly what the file says. Reach for
  these to read or hand-edit a plan. To *do* a job, `codeaf do` is the one that
  thinks while it works. The four used to be top-level verbs — `plan`, `show`,
  `revise` and `run` — and those spellings still work for one release, printing
  one line that names the new one.
- `codeaf run <program> --input <file.json>` — run one saved program on typed
  input. It was `codeaf run subharness <name>`; `run` used to name this and the
  pipeline both.

## Writing the task for `codeaf do`

The task is whatever you pass, byte for byte, and it may begin with anything.
A brief written as a bullet list is a brief:

```
codeaf do "- Update the display style property
- Keep the grid measurable"
```

A flag is only a flag when `do` declares one by that name, so a leading `-` on
your own words is your own words. A misspelling is still refused — `--dbb` is an
error rather than part of the task — and `--` ends the flags if you ever need a
task that is one dashed word.

You can also hand it the task on standard input: `codeaf do -` reads it, and so
does `codeaf do` with something piped in. `codeaf do` with nothing piped and
nothing typed prints the usage instead of waiting.

## When a run says `✗ … the call was retried`

A line like

```
  ✗ Core engine                  — nothing came back from the model in 1m30s → the call was retried, routed away from deepinfra
```

means one model call went quiet and was cut. **The call was asked again, not the
work.** Everything the worker had already done is still in hand, and the endpoint
that went quiet is set aside for a few minutes so the retry goes somewhere else.

## When work is picked up again, restarted or resumed — `⏳`, `↻` and `✗`

If a piece of work does have to be picked up again, the stream says so and says
why. Four lines, and they are four different things:

```
  ⏳ Core engine                  — it was still working when it ran out of its 15m0s — 72 turns in
  ↻ Core engine                  — picked up again from 45 recorded turns — it was still working when it ran out of its time
  ✗ Core engine                  — picked up again — no sign of life for 24m3s …
  ↻ Core engine                  — resumed from 45 recorded turns, already holding styles.ts, grid-layout.ts
```

`⏳` is work that ran out of the room it was given — its time, its turns or its
tokens. **Nothing failed**: it was still working, and what it reached is kept.

`↻ picked up again from N recorded turns` is what follows it: the piece goes
back on the queue with its record, and the count is how much is waiting there
for whoever takes it next. **This is progress, not a fault** — running out of
room is the input the planner uses to decide whether the piece needs more of it.

The rest of that line is **why** the piece went back — its time, its turns, its
token budget with the figures, or a worker that stopped answering. It is on the
line itself rather than only on the `⏳` above it, so one `↻` you scroll back to
a day later still says what ended the attempt.

`✗ picked up again` is the backstop, and it is the only one of the four that is
a fault. Work is only taken off a worker that has shown **no sign of life** for
the whole window, which is well past any deadline the worker itself was given. A
command that is still running counts, however long it takes — a build or a test
suite that takes ten minutes is a worker at work, not a worker to interrupt. A
worker that keeps working keeps its work.

And the worker is **stopped first**. Nothing else can pick the work up until the
one that had it has actually let go, so two workers never share one folder.

`↻ resumed from N recorded turns` is the piece being taken up again, and the
count is the point. It continues from what it had reached: an outline of every
turn it took, the last of them word for word, and the files it had already
changed. **It does not start over.**

## When a worker catches its own mistake before handing work over

A worker reads the project's own checks and the project's own public names
before it starts and again when it thinks it has finished. If that second
reading finds something **the worker itself broke**, the work is not handed over
yet — the worker is told, while it is still sitting there with the whole job in
mind, and asked to settle it:

```
  ↻ Core engine                  — closing its own finding: lost public names (3 names)  1m12s
```

Four things it will be told about, and they are all things measured off the files
rather than anybody's opinion:

- **lost public names** — a name the project spelled before this work and does
  not spell now, in a file this work changed.
- **unbound names** — a name this work's code reads that nothing anywhere
  defines. This is the one that breaks every test on import.
- **its own checks** — the checks this work wrote are red.
- **checks it turned red** — checks that passed before this work and fail after.

**Why it is done this way.** The alternative is to hand the work over, let the
review catch it, and put a fresh worker on the repair — and a fresh worker has
none of the reasoning that caused the mistake. In one measured run three fresh
workers each deleted what the last one had relied on. The one who made the
mistake is the cheapest person to ask, and they are still there.

### What it costs, and the two limits on it

**Nothing extra unless something is actually wrong.** A worker whose second
reading is clean is handed over immediately.

- **Only what the worker had left.** It gets no new time, no new turns and no new
  money — it spends what it had not spent of its own. A worker that is out of
  room hands the work over with the finding, exactly as before.
- **Once per kind of finding.** If the second look is still red, the work is
  handed over and the finding goes to the review the way it always did. It is
  never asked about the same thing twice.

The worker may also answer that the finding has to stand — a name it deliberately
renamed, a check the request asked it to remove — and say so in what it hands
over. That is a real answer, not a refusal.

## There is no web surface

Everything is the terminal chat and these commands. If you want codeaf running
somewhere you are not sitting, the shape is the standing watch — an OS timer
running `codeaf wake` against the same durable brain — not a server.
