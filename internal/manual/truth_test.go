// THE PAGES QUOTE FIGURES THE CODE OWNS, AND MARKDOWN CANNOT INTERPOLATE.
//
// Every other gate around this corpus asks whether a name is MENTIONED. None of
// them can see whether the sentence around the name is still true, which is how
// the crew grew a fifth seat while three pages went on saying four — including
// the page somebody reads on their first day, which quoted the first-run screen
// back at them with the wrong number in it. Nothing was red for it.
//
// This file is the interpolation Markdown does not have. A figure a page states
// is written here ONCE as a sentence with a hole in it, the hole is filled from
// the code that owns the figure at test time, and the page must contain the
// result. Move the constant and every page still carrying the old figure goes
// red, named, with the owner beside it — which is the whole of what a person
// fixing it needs to know.
//
// IT IS A TABLE AND NOT A TEST PER FACT. One bespoke test per number is how the
// last one of these ended up covering exactly one claim; a row is cheap enough
// that adding a figure to a page and adding it here are the same size of work.

// quotedFact is one figure the code owns and the pages repeat in prose.
