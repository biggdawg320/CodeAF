# use_skill — list or get a skill from the shelf

## What it does

Reads the shelf of active skills this conversation can use: the skills a
person already has for Claude Code, Codex and the other agentskills.io
harnesses, read in place from their folders, and the procedures codeaf saved
after watching them run. `use_skill` has two modes, the way `jobs` and
`settings` do:

- **`list`** — shows every active skill by name with its one-line doc. No internal fields, no paths.
- **`get`** — resolves one name to its path and full doc, which you then `read`. For a skill that arrived as a `SKILL.md` folder the path is that `SKILL.md` file, where it lives; nothing is copied.

## How to use it

```
use_skill mode=list
use_skill mode=get name=linter
```

The name is the skill's folder name, as `list` printed it. A name that
differs only in case still resolves — `release-notes` and `Release-Notes` are
the same skill — and the answer spells the name the shelf holds, so the name you
read back is the one that works next time.

## When a name misses

A name that matches nothing does not dead-end. The answer says how many skills
are active on the shelf and names the nearest handful, so you can re-ask with a
name the shelf actually holds. An empty shelf says so in one plain line.

## Why it exists

A skill whose description shares words with a message is already carried with
it (the dim `skills ·` line), and the prompt lists every skill on the shelf
with what it is for. `use_skill` is the door onto their bodies: the model
opens the one a request fits, even when the request shares no words with it.

## Can you use skills with memory off

Yes. Skills do not depend on the `memory.enabled` setting. With memory on, the
shelf lives in the same database memory uses. With memory off, codeaf opens no
memory database at all and builds a shelf of its own at launch from the skill
folders on disk, and throws it away when the conversation's process ends. The
same skills are found either way, a message still carries the skills that suit
it, `use_skill` is still on the belt, and `/skill` still attaches them.

What memory off does change: the procedures codeaf saved after watching them
run live in the memory database, so with memory off only the skills in
folders are on the shelf.

## Where the shelf comes from

Every launch reads the skill folders before the first message is built and
records each skill as an active fact whose path is the ORIGINAL folder. An
edited `SKILL.md` is read again at the next launch, and a deleted folder drops
off the shelf. The page `skills-from-other-tools` lists every folder read and
which copy wins when two share a name.

## Tool name

The verb is `use_skill` on the belt. A belt that does not carry `propose_task` does not carry this verb either (it is gated on the same condition plus a shelf to read).
