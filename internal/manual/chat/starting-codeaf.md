# What codeaf is, and how you start it

## What codeaf is

codeaf is a working colleague in a terminal. You talk to it in ordinary language,
and it works in the directory you started it in — reading, writing, running
commands, searching, and handing longer jobs off to run on their own while you
keep talking. The window is where you sat down, and it stays there; the
conversation can go on to be **about** other folders as well, which is how work in
another project happens without opening another window (see *Choosing a folder*).

It is a conversation you sit in front of. There is one conversation **on screen**
at a time, it is written down as you go, and you can leave it and come back to it.
One terminal can hold several at once — up to eight, each on its own project, one
in front and the rest running behind it; `tab` and home move between them. It is
not a background service and it does not keep working after you close the window:
the work happens while you are here, except for jobs and tasks it has already
started, which have their own rules.

## What it is called

The command you type is `codeaf`, and `codeaf` is what the surface calls itself
everywhere it speaks: the wordmark on the first screen and in the welcome box, the
name on home's top line, the first line of `/help`, the card that asks to connect
an account, the desktop notification's title, and the speaker heading in an
exported conversation.

There is one name now. The history and the compatibility spellings that remain
are in *The old name* below.

## The old name — what happened to aforge, is this the same thing as aforge or the CodeAF from the benchmarks, and why the folder is .codeaf

codeaf was called `aforge` until 2026-09-14, and the repository it is built in
was `aforge-v2`. It is the same program, by one name now. `openaf` was a planned
name that appeared in one early wordmark and never shipped a release.

Three things you already have keep working, so nothing on your machine has to be
moved by hand:

- **Your state folder.** The first time the renamed build starts it renames
  `~/.aforge` to `~/.codeaf` and tries to leave a link behind at the old path, so a
  `PATH` line pointing at `~/.aforge/bin`, a login item, a running daemon or a
  script of your own still resolves. It happens once, it never overwrites a
  `~/.codeaf` directory that is already there. If the move itself cannot be done,
  it says so and carries on reading the old folder.
- **Your environment variables.** A variable spelled `AFORGE_…` is still read
  wherever the `CODEAF_…` one is unset or empty — `AFORGE_HOME` still moves the state
  folder, for example. Set the new spelling when you next edit that file;
  `codeaf help env` lists the names.
- **A repository you have already used.** `.aforge-v3/config.json` inside a
  project is still read when there is no `.codeaf/config.json` beside it. codeaf
  writes the new one and never rewrites your repository on its own.

If you have seen “CodeAF” as the name of a coding harness in a benchmark table,
that is a different program and nothing here talks to it.

## Starting it

| What you type | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| `codeaf` | the home screen, over this directory's most recent conversation |
| `codeaf chat` | the same thing |
| `codeaf chat --session <path>` | that conversation, straight in, no home screen |
| `codeaf resume` | the chat, opened on the picker of earlier conversations |
| `codeaf chat --host devbox` | the chat here, the work on another machine |

**The very first launch on a machine with nothing configured** opens on a short setup
instead — connect OpenRouter in your browser, check the chat model, set the spending rails —
and then on the empty conversation. The preference questions are shown once. The
OpenRouter step returns on any later local interactive launch while no key exists,
including a named or resumed conversation using the default service, and `enter` on an
unsent message brings it back without clearing the draft. A conversation on a connected
direct service's model sends without an OpenRouter key and does not open that step. The
getting-started page has the whole flow. First run does not offer Codex; connect a
ChatGPT plan later from the Codex row in `/connect` or with `codeaf connect codex`.

A `--once` or piped run cannot open a browser. When its model uses the keyless default
service it stops at the door with `codeaf chat needs a model to talk with.` Its next line
says to run bare `codeaf` in a terminal to connect OpenRouter, or to export
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`). A connected direct service can carry that run
instead. A custom `CODEAF_BASE_URL` is never offered the OpenRouter connection.
That variable still changes only the default service. To add a supported second place
models come from, connect a service through `/connect`; the [services page](services.md)
explains the checked connection and picker names.

**The first frame is home** — every project on this machine and every conversation
in them — with the conversation this directory would have opened loaded and ready
underneath it. `esc`, or `enter` on the row the cursor starts on, drops into that
conversation; everything after that is the chat exactly as it always was. Home
stays out of the way when you name a conversation, on a `--once` or `--host` run,
and on a machine whose only conversation is the one already open — though it is
still there to go to: `esc` from the conversation, or `/home`, opens it on that
machine too. The home page covers the whole of it.

Run it in the directory you want it to work in. That directory is where it stands
— what a bare filename means, where its `AGENTS.md` and project settings come from
— and it is shown in the status line so you can always tell. It never moves for
the life of the conversation. Starting in the "wrong" place is not a dead end,
though: name the folder you actually meant with `/folder`, and the work goes
there.

## /status says an older build is holding this conversation

On every launch codeaf performs one sweep: it reads every presence file under
`~/.codeaf/v3/projects`, and if a live session there is running from an older
rev than this binary's own, one line in the conversation names the pids. That
is all `on an older build` means — the sweep warns. It never blocks, never
locks, never kills.

The `/status` build line shows the serving process's build: for a chat that is
the process typed `codeaf` with; for a conversation hosted by the resident
engine (`engine --daemon`) it is still whatever binary the engine launched
from. In both cases the fix is a close: close the older session or the older
engine, and its next open runs this build. No line at launch means nothing
stale is running.

## The flags you can start it with

| Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--model <slug>` | start on a particular model instead of the configured default |
| `--reasoning <level>` | how hard the model is asked to think: `off`, `low`, `medium` or `high` |
| `--session <path>` | open a particular conversation file instead of the most recent |
| `--host <host[:path]>` | run the conversation on another machine over ssh |
| `--once "<text>"` | send one message and print its replies — normally it then exits; with `--yolo` and a budget it stays until handed-over work is home or the limit ends it |
| `--no-compact` | never shorten the conversation automatically |
| `--yolo` | run every tool without asking, subject to the limits that nothing lifts |
| `--max-hours <n>` | with `--yolo`: elapsed-time limit; interactive chat checks before new turns, and the window closes itself two minutes after it |
| `--max-cost <n>` | with `--yolo`: dollar limit; interactive chat checks before new turns |
| `--one-model` | every text call this session makes runs on the session model |

`--yolo` does not make codeaf unstoppable: a small set of destructive commands
and anything that acts in your name still ask, whatever the setting says. See the
permissions page.

## Does a time limit stop a running task?

Yes. The elapsed-time limit (`--max-hours`) is measured from when this session opened,
and a run that `/task` starts is handed whatever is left of it. When that time is up the
run starts nothing new, the work still going is ended where it is, and what had finished
comes home the ordinary way. The run's row ends `incomplete` and says
`a time limit you set stopped it`; a run stopped by its spend ceiling names the
dollar limit on the same line, so the two limits read apart. A task that was cut part way
through reads `incomplete` too.

The dollar limit on a run is what is left of the conversation's spend ceiling, or of
`--max-cost` when that is the smaller. A run's
spend is counted as each model call is paid for, while its tasks are still working, so
one long task cannot carry the run far past the figure. A run that reaches it ends the
work still going and its row says `a dollar limit you set stopped it`, just as a
run its elapsed-time limit ended names the time limit. The call that reached the limit is
already paid for, so the run can end a little over it.

## Leaving it running on its own · leaving a headless run going with a budget · --once yolo · no screen · unattended · overnight · nobody watching

`--yolo` changes tool approvals. Normal interactive chat remains a conversation you
can steer, even with a budget: an unrelated question does not become a new assignment
for running tasks, and the first request does not remain a fixed goal for every later
reply. Tasks retain their own assignments until you revise them.

For a fixed unattended goal, use the one-message door with a budget:

    codeaf chat --once "finish the import fix" --yolo --max-hours 6
    codeaf chat --once "finish the import fix" --yolo --max-cost 20

## Does a run with no screen carry its own work on · headless --once checkpoints

Yes, when launched with `--once`, `--yolo` and a time or cost budget. A headless
unattended run checkpoints long replies at the same points. Its decisions are
kept in the transcript, where a run without a screen can still be inspected.

Moving a reply's work onto a task does not end that run. The command stays alive
while the task is running; when the task lands, its report starts another reply
on the same command. It exits only when no task is still moving and no reply is
in flight, or when its limit ends the run. A plain `--once` run, and `--once
--yolo` with no budget, remain one message, one reply and one exit.

Either limit alone is enough; both means whichever runs out first. The defaults can
come from `CODEAF_MAX_HOURS` and `CODEAF_MAX_COST`; explicit flags take precedence.
A headless `--yolo` launch without a budget stops when the model stops.

## Interactive chat limits · --max-hours · --max-cost

In normal interactive chat, `--max-hours` and `--max-cost` are checked before a new
turn starts, including a reply started by background work. They do not freeze the
conversation's goal. The time limit uses the current engine session's clock; the
money limit uses its recorded cumulative cost. An exhausted limit refuses the next
turn before recording your message or calling a model.

A turn already running and work already delegated may finish. These are not hard
reservations across every concurrent task, so the final bill can exceed a limit.
`/budget` remains a separate conversation spending limit; the stricter dollar limit
applies. Launch limits are changed by relaunching with different flags. A refusal
states which launch limit was reached.

The local persistent host carries these launch settings. Explicit `--host` still
refuses the budget flags at its door; configure that machine's launch instead.

## Does --max-hours close the window · the process keeps running after the time limit

Yes. **Two minutes after `--max-hours` runs out, the window closes itself**, with or without
`--no-host`. The limit first stops the work at the time you gave — the running work ends
where it is and the ending line is written — and the two minutes are there so you can read
it. Then codeaf leaves the way a `kill` asks it to: the unsent sentence kept, every
conversation closed and its transcript flushed. If that has not finished thirty seconds
later, it exits at once.

It used to stop the work and then sit on the message box for a person. A window with
nobody at it — a script, a benchmark, a terminal left in the background — stayed open for
days: three `--max-hours 0.15` windows were found alive forty-three hours later.

`--max-cost` does not close the window; it stops the work and leaves the conversation open.

## What changes when you give it a budget — done when, carrying on by itself, tidying up after itself

For a fixed headless goal (`--once --yolo` with a budget), six things change:

- **It writes down what finished means.** At the start it turns your ask into one
  `done when` sentence and shows it to you on a dim line. That sentence is fixed
  for the whole session — nothing it does later can rewrite it. It is context for
  the work and never evidence about it: what says the work is done is the work.
- **A stopped turn is looked at rather than taken at its word.** When it stops
  talking, it checks whether any piece of work came home unfinished, and whether
  the checks your work names passed when they ran. If any of that is unmet it
  carries on by itself instead of going quiet — and if none of it is, the ask is
  finished, whatever else was said about it.
- **A piece of work that came home unfinished starts its own next go.** You used
  to be offered a follow-up in your own words — with nobody there, that offer went
  nowhere. Now what was missing becomes the next brief. If the same thing stops it
  three times in a row it stops for good and says so.
- **It tidies up after itself before it says it is done.** It reads the checks in
  a fresh shell, reusing an answer already taken over the same unchanged tree, then
  looks at every file it made: anything inside the folder
  it is working in is part of the answer and is left alone, and anything it wrote
  outside that folder is scratch and is deleted. It never touches a file it did
  not create, and it never touches one it only changed.
- **It stays for work it hands over, and says every ending.** Moving work onto a
  task ends that reply, not the run. The command waits while the task is moving,
  and the task's landing starts the next reply there on its own. Reply text is
  written to standard output. The handover line and every ending — including
  `finishing here · what was asked is done` and `stopping here · ` — are written
  to standard error, so a piped answer contains no commentary.
- **The hours end the run even while its work is out.** The run cannot continue
  past the hours you gave it, whether work is out or not: the wall is read while
  the conversation is idle as well as at the end of a reply. If time runs out
  with a task still running, that task is stopped through the usual stop: its row
  settles, and its branch, working copy and everything it did are kept. Nothing
  starts after the wall. If a reply is still speaking, the wall waits; that reply
  reaches its own ending and stops there instead of being sealed from outside.

## Why did it stop at a task that was finished

If it ended without starting more work, or did not hand the work over, the
budgeted run checked whether anything remained before starting another task.

## It ended without starting more work · why did it not hand the work over

With a budget, **every** way a turn ends is read, not just the ones where the model stops
talking. A long turn can also end by having its work moved onto a task — when a second
reader says the work has parts, when the turn has changed enough files, when it has run
past its own price, or — only with a budget — when it has had its share of the hours you
gave the run. Each of those seals the turn, and until this they sealed it without
asking anything: the run then had no way back at all, because the only thing that could end
it was a landing waking a turn that moved its work onto another task, and so on until the
hours ran out. Three measured runs finished their work, went green, and still ran to the
wall that way.

So before the work moves, the same reading a stopped turn gets is taken:

- **Something of yours is still running** — the work moves onto a task exactly as it always
  did, and you read the same line about it.
- **Nothing is left and nothing is running** — the run ends there, on the line
  `finishing here · what was asked is done`, and **no task is started**. It used to hand the
  work over anyway, on the grounds that the reply had not yet read its last results; measured,
  that started two tasks nineteen seconds after the run had already read the tree, the checks
  and the second reader and said the ask was met, and both ran to the wall. Being finished is
  read from those, not from the reply's own words, so nothing a further reply said could change
  it. If a piece of work is still running when that happens, it is not ended there: the work
  moves onto a task as usual and the same answer is read again at the next ending.
- **The same thing is left as last time** — it stops for good with the reason, on the same
  `stopping here · ` line every other stop uses. If a piece of work is still running when
  that happens, it does **not** stop there: the work moves onto a task as usual and the same
  stop is said again at the next ending, once nothing is in flight.
- **The hours or the money ran out** — this is the one stop that does not buy another
  reply. Waiting is more of exactly what ran out, so a reply already speaking reaches its
  own ending even with work still going, and says so on the end of its line:
  `· work was still going and was left where it was`. A money-only ceiling leaves that
  work where it is. If the hours ran out, the wall reader then stops the work through its
  usual stop and says `· work was still going, so it was stopped and what it did was kept`.
  Nothing is thrown away, and its branch and working copy are kept.

**And a handover it asked for is never dropped.** A long turn can normally talk its own
handover out of happening: if the model says nothing is left and the second reader's sketch
does not name independent parts still to do, the work stays where it is and the turn
finishes. It gets that **once per request**, whether or not the sketch agreed — a turn that
says it is done and then keeps working is met by the next look with the claim already spent.
On a run with a budget that
only holds while the run's own owner agrees — and when it has just read the ending and said
the ask is **not** finished, the work moves anyway, on its account of what is left rather
than on your bare sentence. A run measured before this said "not yet confirmed" at its
write seam and again at its ceiling, had both handovers thrown away by the two readers, and
ended eight hundred seconds later inside a `git stash` with the fix uncommitted.

**And for a fixed headless goal, one reply may spend at most a third of the wall.** *Why did it move my
work to a task after five minutes; it kept running tests for ten minutes and then handed it
over; why did it not hand over sooner.* The other three ways above all COUNT something —
parts in a sketch, files changed, rounds spent — and a reply that spends its time reading
and running tests crosses none of them. A measured run did exactly that: a fifteen-minute
wall, the fix working in the checkout at five minutes, twelve and a half minutes of reading
and tests inline, the work finally moved with 147 seconds left, sixty of which went on
opening the task's working copy — and the wall came down on a task that had committed
nothing, checked nothing and landed nothing. So a reply that has been running for a third of
the hours you gave the run hands over, and you read:

```
this has taken a third of the time · moving it to a task that can be checked before the wall
```

**A third, because the other two thirds are what the work needs after it moves** — a working
copy opened, the job run, and somebody who is not the model that did it reading the result,
which is the whole difference between work that happened and work that landed. **And it hands over only what can still be checked before the wall**: once less of the
wall remains than a task needs to open its working copy and be checked — the two waits a
task is already held to, added — a reply is not moved at all, and nothing is spent asking,
because a task started then could not be set up, let alone checked; a measured run started
one with six seconds to go. It happens
**once** in a reply; rounds spent only watching work you already handed out do not count
towards it; and it needs a wall, so `--max-cost` on its own never triggers it.

None of this applies to a session you are sitting in front of: your turn's work moves onto a
task exactly as it always has, nothing is decided for you, and a reply that says nothing is
left still leaves your answer where it is. There is no wall on your session, so there is no share
of one either, however long your reply runs.

## What counts as still left · a task that died on the wire · it kept working after everything was finished

**What is left is read from the tree, not from a task's death.** A run with a budget looks
at every piece of work at the end of each reply and asks what stands between it and
finished. Two kinds of dead task do **not** count:

- **One that died on the connection or was refused by the model provider.** A dropped
  stream, an API error, a model that is not there: nothing was found out about the job, so
  it is not evidence that anything is unfinished. Every other ending still counts — a check
  that found gaps, a loop that went round, a step limit, a working copy that could not be
  made, one you stopped yourself.
- **One whose files somebody else wrote and brought home.** If every file a dead task was
  going to change has since been changed by a task that finished **and** merged, the thing
  it was for is on your branch already, and asking for it again would rewrite a file that is
  already written. It has to be every file and the other task has to have merged; half of
  somebody's work is still work.

Measured before this: a task died on an API 404 an hour before its parent wrote the very
file it was for, went green and merged. The run read the dead sibling as a gap in the ask
and carried on over a finished tree until its wall ran out.

## Inline work is finished with a witness · the reader timed out · it did the work twice · it says nothing has been finished yet after editing or creating a file

**Work codeaf did itself counts as finished work with a second opinion.** A session that
made the change and wrote the tests **inline**, with no task at all, has finished something
when the second reader agrees nothing is left. That includes one edit to an existing file;
older runs counted only new files and could stop themselves over a green fix while saying
`nothing has been finished yet`. If the reader names a gap, the run carries on into that gap
whatever the checks say.

**If the second reader could not be reached, silence is not treated as a gap.** On an
unattended run codeaf actually runs your declared checks over the tree and lets a green
reading stand in, saying `the reader could not be reached, so the checks stood in for it`.
A red check carries the run on with that command named. At least one declared check must
start and finish: with no check declared, or none that ran, nothing can stand in and the run
carries on exactly as before. An install with no reader is different from a failed call;
that absence runs no check on its own.

## A changed file counts only while its content differs · a reverted or stashed edit is not finished work

**A file is your work only while its content still differs from what it was before the
edit.** A change put back the way it was, a revert, or a fix pushed onto `git stash` and
never popped leaves the path written and nothing in the tree, so none of them counts as
finished work. A stash the run took itself and never popped is said out loud as well —
`1 stash entry holds work that is not in the tree` — and the run carries on rather than
finishing over it; a stash you already had before the run started is yours and is never
counted, and neither is the one a landing takes to set your uncommitted work aside.

## An emptied, blank or zero-byte created file does not count as finished work

**A file the run created counts as its work only while there is something in it.** A
rewrite that produced nothing, a generator that wrote no bytes, or a `> file` in a shell
step can leave it emptied, blank, or at zero bytes; none of those empty files counts as
finished work. It is still your file: nothing inside the folder codeaf is working in is
ever deleted, whatever is in it.

## The git an unattended run left on its own will not run · why it refused to stash, checkout, pull or reset --hard

**A session left running on its own with a budget answers to the same git list as a
task.** It decides on its own word that the work is done, and a stash can make that word
false by taking the work out of the tree it judges. The refusal happens before the shell
runs.

It will not run `stash` in any form except `stash list` and `stash show`; `merge`,
`rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `revert`, `checkout`, `switch`, `am`, `apply`, `worktree`,
`update-ref`, or `symbolic-ref`; `pull`, `fetch`, `clone`, `remote`, or `submodule`;
`push`; `reset --hard`, `reset --merge`, or `reset --keep`; or `restore --source`.
These are one list: they take the working copy away, put it onto work the session did not
do, bring in remote work, or send the session's work to a shared remote on its own word.

**Reading is still allowed.** `git status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, `branch --list`,
`stash list`, and `stash show` can look at any branch. Plain `git reset` can unstage,
plain `git restore <path>` can restore the session's own path, and `git add` and
`git commit` are allowed. For a stash, the session reads exactly:

> git stash is not yours to run here: it takes your working copy away, and what is in it is the work this session will be judged on. Leave the change in the tree, or commit it.

The `1 stash entry holds work that is not in the tree` reading in the section above says
the stash out loud after the fact; this refusal is why there is now usually nothing for
that reading to say. None of these refusals applies to a session you are sitting in front
of, or to an unattended run that named no ceiling: nothing is deciding on its own that
the work is done then, and your git is your own.

## It keeps saying the tests fail but they were already failing · red before the work · a check that was broken when I started

**A check is yours only if your run introduced new red.** On a run with a budget, codeaf runs
the checks its acceptance names once at the start — before it has touched anything — and
writes down which were already failing. Only the acceptance it wrote for the work and each
task's own brief supply checks; a command pasted into your ask (the steps you took to see a
bug, say) is never run as one — `$ chmod 000 tox.ini` in a pasted issue once was, and no
longer is. At the end it reads them again, reusing an answer already taken when the tree has
not moved. A check that was **green before and red after** counts as work still to do. When
a runner names individual failures, a new failure inside a command that was already red
also counts; unparsed red stays uncertain.

That first reading runs **in the background**, so nothing waits for it: your first turn
starts straight away. It gets one window for the whole set rather than one per check, and
two things are deliberately not read — a check that **changed the tree** (a build, a
formatter, a migration: that would be codeaf making the first edit, not looking) and a
check the shell **could not run at all**. Writing a cache or a coverage file is not
changing the tree: in a git repository the question is asked against what the project
itself keeps, so anything your `.gitignore` covers is invisible here and a test runner's
`.pytest_cache/` costs you nothing.

**A check the reading could not take is never counted against you — or for you.** Nobody
knows whose red it is, so it is left out of the arithmetic in both directions rather than
guessed at. Until the whole reading lands the same is true of every check, and the run says
so in as many words. At the very end it waits for the reading before deciding. Missing
before-evidence remains unknown; waiting does not turn it into a passing check.

That matters because of the sentence people naturally write: *"the existing test suite
passes"*. Over a project whose suite already has one failing test, that can never become
true, and a run that reads its own failure in the project's will spend its whole ceiling on
somebody else's bug. One measured run did exactly that.

What was already broken is not hidden from the work either — the brief it carries on with
says so plainly, so nothing goes off to fix it by accident:

```
1 check was already failing before this work; that does not show the requested result works: tox -e py
```

This section describes the session's own end-of-reply reading, which runs only when you
leave a session working with a budget. A task's checker takes its separate before-reading
whether you are watching or away; **The check says my tests fail but they were already
failing** in *How tasks run* explains that task reading and its limits.

## A task added a check after work started · no before-reading for a late check

A task can name a check after the session has already taken its initial reading. The
session still runs that check at completion, but cannot tell whether its failure existed
before the work. It records which commands the initial reading covered; a later command
stays unknown rather than becoming a new regression just because it has no earlier entry.
The ending or continuation names that uncertainty, for example:

```
one check has no usable before-reading, so its current result cannot establish a regression from this work: check-report
```

An unknown result does not prove the requested result works. A task still running, a
failed task or work that has not reached its requested destination still keeps the session
from finishing. A check actually read before work that turns from green to red still
counts as work left to do.

## It ran the same tests three times · it ran out of time running the tests · why did it say unchecked at the end

A declared check runs once for one state of the tree. When a later reader looks at the same
unchanged tree, it gets the answer already taken instead of starting the command again. A cancelled check or one that never started supplies no reusable answer. If
the tree has moved underneath that answer, codeaf runs the check again, because the old
answer describes a tree that no longer exists.

With a budget that names hours, one check is given the smaller of five minutes and what is
left of those hours. A check that cannot fit the time left is **not started**. A run that
finishes in that shape says, for example:

```
finishing here · what was asked is done · unchecked: there was not enough time left to run tox -e py
```

That means the work is finished and nothing has confirmed the named command. Ending there
is better than spending the remaining hours re-running a suite over a green tree and then
running out of time.

## It stopped and said the same thing was still left · why did it keep saying carry on · it kept repeating the same thing · it argued with itself about something already answered

An unattended run with a budget looks at the work at the end of every reply: which
pieces of work came home finished, and what the checks your work names said when
they ran. If something is left, it carries on by itself with that as the brief.

That brief names the concrete gap: unfinished work, missing delivery or a new check
failure. A second reader's explanation cannot replace that gap with another obligation.
For an answer made directly in the conversation with no task result, the reader can
still identify a missing part of the requested answer.

**The same thing left twice running stops the run.** The evidence that a run is
getting anywhere is that what is left CHANGES. When it reaches the end of a reply
holding exactly the list it held last time, it stops and tells you, on one line:

```
stopping here · nothing moved since the last look and what is left is the same — wire the handlers did not finish · saying it again would not change it
```

That is the whole message: what is still left, and that it stopped rather than say
it again. Nothing crashed and nothing is wrong with your machine — the list in the
middle is where to pick the work up.

**It holds for the rest of the session.** The floor belongs to the thing that
decides, not to the reply it stopped, so a piece of work landing and waking a fresh
reply cannot start the loop over. There is no number to raise and no setting for
it. Before this, a run in that state repeated one identical line until its hours
ran out.

**And an ordinary conversation you are sitting in front of has the same floor.**
There is no budget and nothing holds for the rest of the session — the next thing
you type starts fresh — but within one reply the rule is identical: the second
look that says exactly what the first one said ends the reply rather than putting
it back to the model. The line names what repeated itself:

```
stopping here · nothing moved since the last look and what is left is the same — the missing zeta.txt has not been reported · saying it again would not change it
```

Before this, only an unattended run had that floor. A measured conversation had
correctly reported that a file did not exist, and the reader claimed three times
running that the missing file had not been reported: the reply spent three turns
explaining that the observation was mistaken, and all three were on the screen.

## It said my answer was cut off when it was not · it argued with the check instead of answering · my table disappeared under worked · [no change]

When a reply ends, codeaf's completion check can read a summary of the turn and send the
model a note that starts with `[carry on]`. You never see that note, and you did not
write it. The model compares it with your request and its own work, then does one of two
things:

- **The note found a real gap.** The model closes the gap and ends with a complete final
  answer. Only that last message stays in view when the turn folds under its `worked`
  line, so it has to carry the whole deliverable again.
- **The note is wrong.** The model replies with exactly `[no change]` and nothing else.
  That ends the reply. The check is not asked again, the same note is not sent again,
  and the answer it gave before the note stays in view, in the chat and when the
  conversation is opened again. It counts only as the model's very next reply to the
  note. After tool calls, after your own message typed in between, or with any other
  words beside it, the reply is checked again as usual. A reply that is only
  `[no change]` is never drawn, whether or not it counted.
  Headless `--once` output is printed as it streams, so if a check runs there the token
  can appear in it.

The summary shows the check up to 8 KB of the reply's last message, less when your request
itself fills most of the summary. A longer message is
cut to fit and ends with `[clipped by codeaf: N of M bytes]`, and the check is told that
this cut belongs to the summary and is never a sign that you saw a cut-off answer. A
table or report under that size reaches the check whole.

Before this, the check saw only the first 600 bytes and the model was told to explain
itself when the note was wrong. A long table read as "cut off", the note was sent three
times, and the model's explanation ended up as the only visible answer.

## A task waiting on one that did not finish · work that will never start · it says something is still running

**Work that is still going is never a standstill, and never finished either.** A
piece of work that is actually moving — started, or queued behind something that
is — is named on the list in its own right, `write the tests is still running`, so
the ask cannot be called finished over the top of it. And a list that has not
changed because it is waiting on that work is a run waiting rather than a run
repeating itself, so the count above starts again once everything has landed.

**Work that cannot start is not waiting, it is left.** A piece of work queued
behind one that did not finish, or behind one that came home needing a decision,
has nothing coming to start it — nobody is going to look at it while the run is
unattended. So it is said whole, with what it waits on and what became of that:

```
wire the handlers is waiting on port the parser, which is your call
```

That counts as part of what is left rather than as a reason to keep going, which
is what lets a run in that state reach the standstill above and stop — instead of
carrying on for the rest of its hours over work nothing was ever going to start.

## It keeps saying a file does not pass · a check nobody asked for

**A check is a command explicitly declared in the task's `checks` field.**
A command quoted in your request, a brief or a `done when` sentence does not
become permission to run it. Declared checks run in a fresh shell to see whether
the work stands up. A file is opened the way the file itself says it opens: if it is
executable, or its first line names the program that runs it, that is what gets
run. **A file that says neither is not a check at all** and is left out — a
source file quoted in a sentence is something to look at, not something to run.

Before this, a bare path was handed to a shell, which refused to start it, and the
run recorded "does not pass" about it for the rest of the evening — a wall no work
could ever get past. Anything that says `does not pass` now is something that ran.

**A file in your own folder beats a program of the same name.** If the tree you are
working in holds a file called `check`, `build` or `test`, that file is what a
check by that name means — not whatever program of the same name your shell would
have found. And if the tree holds it but nothing can start it, nothing is run at
all: running a different program of the same name would be worse than running
nothing.

**What came home outranks what was said about it.** A piece of work that finished
and covers what you asked for, with every check that ran passing, is finished — a
reader's opinion about the transcript cannot carry the run on over the top of it.

## Which folder does codeaf work in, and where do my files go

It depends on where you started it, and there are two cases. (Where the conversation
**stands** is one thing; the folders it turns out to be **about** are another, and *Choosing
a folder* has that half. This section is about where you are standing.)

**You started it inside a project.** codeaf borrows that directory. Its tools read
and write your repository, exactly where you are standing — and that stays true of it
however many other folders the conversation turns out to be about, because a folder you
chose with `/folder` is written through a copy and landed with `/land` instead, and the status line
shows that directory's name — `app`, `my-site` — until the conversation names
itself, so you can always tell which project this conversation is about. The full
path is on `/status` and on the status sheet, under `place`, with the git branch
beside it.

**You started it anywhere else** — your home directory, a temp folder, a
launcher with no directory in mind. Then the conversation gets a workspace of
its own, inside its session folder, and anything it writes lands there instead
of scattered across wherever you happened to be. In that case the place reads
simply:

```
codeaf
```

That word means "no project — this conversation has its own space". The real
path exists and is not a secret; it is just codeaf's own bookkeeping, and
showing it where you look to answer "which project am I in" told you nothing.
Type `/status` and the `place` line gives you the full path to copy.

An owned workspace of that kind is quietly made into a git repository, so work
done there has undo history like work done anywhere else — and so a task started
in such a conversation branches from it and merges home exactly as a task in a
project does. **A conversation with no project still runs tasks**; nothing has to
be anchored first. See *A task in a conversation with no project* on the page
about how work on its own runs.

## Where do task files go when I did not open a project — work lives inside the conversation

Inside the conversation's own folder, and nowhere else. A conversation opened outside any
project owns a scratch workspace, and that workspace is a `work/` directory in the session
folder:

```
~/.codeaf/v3/projects/<project folder>/<conversation folder>/work
```

`/status` prints that full path on its `place` line. Read it there rather than assembling
it — the two folder names are encoded, not typed.

That containment is the point: nothing is scattered across wherever you happened to be
standing, and closing the conversation leaves nothing behind anywhere else. It is also the
sharp edge — **the work is inside the conversation, so deleting the conversation deletes
the work.** See *I deleted my chat and lost the files the task made* below.

**A task is never refused for want of a project.** That scratch workspace is quietly made a
git repository when the conversation opens, so a code task branches from it and merges home
exactly as a task in a real project does. An older codeaf stopped such a task with `this
task needs a project; use /workspace <path> or name where it should work`; nothing says that
any more.

And a conversation that has been somewhere else goes there instead: a folder you named, or
one this conversation turned out to be about, is where the work stands, and the scratch
workspace is not used at all. *A task in a conversation with no project* has the whole of
it.

## I deleted my chat and lost the files the task made

If the conversation owned its workspace, they are gone and there is no second copy. The
files were in `work/` inside the session folder (above), so removing that folder under
`~/.codeaf/v3/projects/` removed the transcript and everything made in that workspace in
one move. Nothing is copied out first and nothing is mirrored anywhere else.

codeaf removes a conversation of its own accord in exactly one case: one you **started in a
temp directory**, seven days after you last said anything to it. Every other conversation
under `~/.codeaf/v3/projects/` stays whatever its age. See *What gets cleaned up, and when*
on the keeping-an-eye page.

**Three ways to keep the work instead**, all of them before the fact rather than after:

- **`/workspace <path>`** anchors the conversation to a repository or folder you keep, and
  everything from then on happens there. It does not move what is already in `work/`, and
  a conversation may do it once.
- **Copy it out yourself.** They are ordinary files; `/status`'s `place` line is the path.
- **`/files`** lists what was made *for* you — pictures, sound, video, exports — with the
  path each landed at, and `ctrl+y` on a row copies one somewhere else. It is a list of
  those, not of every file a task wrote.

`/export <path>` writes **the conversation** to a file: what was said, not the files that
were made. It is not a way to rescue the work.

## Anchor a conversation to a repository or folder — /workspace and the workspace tool

When a conversation says `codeaf` because it opened with no project, type `/workspace
<path>` to make the repository or folder at that path its project. The path may begin with
`~`; a path inside a Git repository resolves to the repository root. The place line changes,
the project's `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are loaded into the conversation instructions,
and future tasks cut their working copies from that repository rather than from the
conversation's own workspace.

The model has the conditional `workspace` tool for the same move when you name a repository
path in ordinary chat. Both doors exist only while the conversation owns a scratch
workspace. Once it is anchored, it stays on that project and both doors refuse another
switch. The resolved path is saved in the conversation's `meta.json`, so reopening it keeps
the anchor.

**And a conversation opened later can be in a different folder from the one you
started in.** `enter` on home opens a row of any project, and typing a path on
home starts a conversation there — each on **its own** workspace, with that
project's approval rules, crew, spend ceiling and saved shapes of work, resolved
the same way this one's were. An unanchored conversation may acquire its project once with
`/workspace`. The status line's place word is
always the folder of the conversation on screen. See home's page under *Open
another project from home*.

**You do not need a second conversation to work on a second project, though.** Where a
conversation stands is fixed and one; what it is **about** is not. On a local session, name
another folder with `/folder` or `/attach <dir>`, or name its path when you ask for the work,
and the work goes there — same conversation, same window. Over `--host`, local folders cannot
be registered on the far conversation; a bare `/attach` still opens the chooser for files.
What a second conversation gets you that this does not is a second set of project settings,
approval rules, crew and ceiling. *Choosing a folder* has the distinction in full.

## Where your conversations are kept

Every conversation is written to disk as it happens, under your home directory in
`.codeaf/v3/projects/`, in a folder named after the project you were working in
and a folder of its own inside that. The conversation's own folder holds the
transcript and everything else the conversation kept. That transcript is what
`codeaf` reopens when you come back, and what the picker lists. Closing the
window, or losing the connection, does not lose what was said.

Opened inside a project, codeaf works in the project and leaves nothing of its
own in it. Opened where there is no project at all — your home directory, a
temporary directory, a launcher — it works in a folder of its own instead, so
scratch files and downloads land somewhere they can be thrown away with the
conversation.

## Where codeaf writes its log — chat.log, the crash log, and why nothing appears on screen

codeaf keeps one log file for the running program: `chat.log`, beside the rest of what it
keeps. With nothing moved that is `~/.codeaf/chat.log`; `CODEAF_HOME` moves it with the
rest of codeaf's state, and `CODEAF_PROFILE_DIR` puts it inside that profile folder
instead. Read it with `cat ~/.codeaf/chat.log`, or `tail -f ~/.codeaf/chat.log` in a
second terminal while codeaf is running.

**Everything the program logs while the conversation is on screen goes there and never on
the screen.** That is on purpose: codeaf takes over the whole terminal, so a warning
printed to it would land spliced into the middle of what you are typing and be gone with
the next redraw. It holds internal warnings, recovered internal faults with their stacks,
and notes about things codeaf fell back from — the kind of thing to send along if you are
reporting something odd. The redirect lasts exactly as long as the conversation is up, and
ordinary output goes back to the terminal when you quit.

**It is the same file however you started.** Opened here, opened on another machine with
`--host`, reached over a relay with `--at`, or handed to a session already running in the
background — all four write to `chat.log` in this machine's profile, the machine you are
sitting at.

If codeaf stops with `codeaf hit an internal fault and had to stop`, the details it points
you at are appended to that same file, so there is one place to look either way. In the
rare case codeaf cannot write there at all — a profile folder it has no permission for —
it leaves the log on the terminal rather than dropping it, on the grounds that a torn
frame is better than a lost warning.

This is not the record of what codeaf sent the model: that is a separate file, read with
`codeaf logs`, and `codeaf logs --path` prints where it is.

## Asking codeaf about itself

codeaf ships with this manual compiled into it, and it reads it with a tool
called `manual` rather than answering about itself from memory. So "what can you
do?", "what does ctrl+b do?", "can you read a PDF?" and "why did you just ask me
that?" are all fair questions to type straight into the conversation. If the
manual has nothing on something, that usually means codeaf does not do it, and it
will tell you so instead of inventing an answer.

## /drafts and the ↑ walk — cleared drafts come back too

`ctrl+u`, a conversation switch, any clear that empties the whole box — codeaf pushes the draft onto a ring of ten (the kill ring, `draftring.go`). The usual `↑` walk, which used to answer about the sent lines, now visits the ring first, dim in front of the sent history. `/drafts` opens the same ring as its own page: a list with `enter` restorer over what is left in the box (that box, too, joins the ring before the restored line takes it), and `d` letting one go for good. A cleared draft is never lost and never keeps its place in the ring once it lands back in the box.
