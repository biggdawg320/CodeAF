# Running on another machine

## What --host is — running this on my dev box, over ssh

`--host` runs the chat surface on the machine you are sitting at, and runs the
conversation on another machine, over ssh.

Everything about the conversation happens over there: the workspace, the files, the tools
it runs, the model key, the session file. Your terminal keeps the screen, the keyboard and
your draft. The two halves talk to each other with a small line-based protocol over the
ssh pipes; you never see it.

```
codeaf chat --host devbox
codeaf resume --host devbox
```

The flag's own help text reads:

```
run the session on another machine over ssh: host, user@host, or host:path/to/project
```

This is a session you sit in front of, the same as a local one — but **it is no longer tied to
this terminal.** The conversation lives on the far machine and your window attaches to it. Close
the lid mid-answer, lose your wifi, kill the terminal: the turn keeps running over there, and
running the same command puts you back in it, including whatever finished while you were away.
See *Staying on that machine* and *When the connection drops*.

The one case where closing really does end it is a far machine running `codeaf engine` by hand
on a pipe, with no session host behind it. Then the pipe **is** the conversation's life. The
surface knows which of the two it has and never promises the stronger one.

## How to type the target

The target is parsed the way `scp` parses one: it splits on the **first** colon.

| What you type | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `--host devbox` | that machine, working in the far machine's **home directory** |
| `--host me@devbox` | the same, with a user name |
| `--host devbox:code/app` | a path **relative to the far machine's home** |
| `--host devbox:/srv/code/app` | an absolute path on the far machine |
| `--host devbox:` | the same as naming no path |

**The path is the far machine's path.** It is passed on as you typed it and resolved over
there. It is never resolved against the directory you are standing in, and tab completion
in your own shell will not help you with it. A relative path is relative to the far
machine's home directory, not to wherever ssh happens to drop you.

Two refusals:

```
--host needs a machine: --host devbox, --host me@devbox, or --host devbox:code/app
```

and, for a target that starts with the colon, a refusal saying the target
`has no machine in front of the colon`.

## What you need to set up first

Nothing, beyond two things you already have.

1. **codeaf is installed on the far machine**, on the PATH that a non-login ssh command
   sees.
2. **`ssh <machine>` already works** from where you are sitting.

There is no daemon to run, no config file of codeaf's own and no key handling, and no port
to open — the two halves talk over the ssh pipes and nothing else. codeaf runs your own
`ssh`, the one on your PATH, so your `~/.ssh/config`, your
host aliases, your keys, your jump hosts and your ssh agent all apply unchanged. If
`ssh devbox` works, `--host devbox` works.

**Anything ssh needs to ask you is asked before the chat takes the screen.** A key
passphrase prompt, an unknown-host-key question, or a version mismatch between the two
builds are plain text on a plain terminal, not a dialog inside a full-screen surface.
ssh's own stderr is printed as it arrives.

## Trying it against your own machine first — `--host localhost`

You do not need a second machine to rehearse this. If `ssh localhost` works on the machine
you are sitting at, `--host localhost` is a real connection over a real ssh pipe, and it
exercises every part of this page except one:

```
codeaf chat --host localhost:code/app
```

The engine starts over there — which is here — through ssh, the session lives in its own
project folder, and dropping the link behaves exactly as it does against a machine across
the room. It is the fastest way to see what a dropped connection looks like before it
happens to you for real.

**What it cannot prove** is that the two halves do not quietly share a disk. Over
`localhost` they do: the same home directory, the same `~/.codeaf`, the same files. So a
path that only works because both ends are one filesystem will pass here and fail against
a real machine. For that, use a machine you actually ssh to.

**To see a drop and a recovery on purpose,** ask for something slow, and from another
terminal kill the ssh child this session started:

```
pkill -f "ssh -T localhost codeaf engine"
```

The status line grows its `connection` segment, the surface redials itself, and the answer
continues rather than restarting. Send something while it is down and the message is not
lost quietly — it comes back as `submit failed: reconnecting to localhost — try that again
in a moment`, and pressing enter again once it is back sends it.

## The far machine says a different version — when the connection cannot be made

The failed dial says what it found, rather than guessing:

- codeaf missing over there:
  `codeaf is not installed on <dest> — install it there, or put it on the PATH that a non-login ssh command sees`
- ssh could not get a session at all: `ssh could not open a session on <dest>`. ssh has
  already printed its own reason on the line above.
- no ssh on this machine: `this machine has no ssh on its path, and --host is ssh`, or
  `could not start ssh: <err>`.

If the two machines run different builds, the connection is refused at the door and this
side says:

```
<dest> runs a different version of codeaf than this machine does — update the older one so both ends speak the same protocol
```

When the **far** machine is the older one it refuses first, and what you see is its own
sentence rather than that one:

```
error: engine: this build speaks protocol <n> and the surface speaks <m> — the two halves have to be the same build
```

The two numbers are the two builds' own protocol versions. They change with releases; what
matters is only that they differ.

If something on that machine is still holding a conversation from the older build, that
same sentence gains a clause naming it, because then the machine — not the binary — is
what is behind:

```
error: engine: this build speaks protocol <n> and the surface speaks <m> — the two halves have to be the same build, and this machine is still running the older one — run codeaf engine --stop here to retire it
```

Either way the fix is one command: update codeaf on the machine that is behind. Nothing is
negotiated down — two builds that might disagree about a frame must not find that out three
turns into a conversation.

## I updated codeaf on that machine and it still says the versions differ

The next connection checks the running build as well as protocol compatibility. An idle old copy is replaced automatically; a busy one is left running and the connection explains how to retire it.

Something over there holds your conversation between connections. It is started by the
first connection and outlives it, which is what lets a turn keep running after you close
the lid — and it is a **running copy of the build that started it**, so replacing the
binary does not replace it. `codeaf version` on that machine reports the new build while
the old one is still answering, which is how you can be told to update something you
updated an hour ago.

So before it hands your window over, `codeaf engine` asks whatever is already holding that
workspace which build it is. The check asks which source the running engine was built from,
so building the same commit twice is the same build and your window attaches to it without
a word; a build from a changed working tree, or one too old to report a stamp at all, counts
as another build. Three things can be true:

- **It is this build.** Your window attaches to it exactly as before. This is the ordinary
  case, and it costs one question on a local socket.
- **It is an older build** — built earlier, from any file, or too old to answer the
  question at all. It is replaced, busy or not: it closes its conversations, flushes their
  transcripts, and a fresh one starts from the binary that is on disk now. The window says
  `replaced the older engine on spark (pid <n>, <build>, <binary>) — this build holds the
  workspace now`.
- **It is a newer build.** Your window joins it. If its wire is one this binary cannot
  speak, the connection is refused, naming this binary as the older one and
  `codeaf engine --status` as the way to see which is newer.

Only if the older engine will not go is the connection refused, in these words:

```
engine: spark is still holding this conversation on an older codeaf — run codeaf engine --stop --workspace /home/you/project on spark
```

**The `--workspace` in that line is not decoration — type it.** `codeaf engine --stop`
with no `--workspace` stops whatever is holding your **home directory**, not the folder the
sentence is about. Without the flag you stop a healthy engine, leave the one being
complained about running, and read the same line again the next time you open codeaf. The
sentence spells the workspace out so the command you copy is the command that works.

One nobody connects to again lets itself go on its own: it notices that the file it was
started from has been removed or rebuilt, and retires the next time it is holding nothing.
`codeaf engine --stop` is on the *Staying on that machine* page.

## What runs on the far machine, and what stays local

The **far** machine owns the conversation and everything it touches:

- the workspace and every file in it
- every tool the session runs
- the API key and the model catalog's credentials
- the tool gate (what needs your approval) and the money limits
- connected accounts
- the harness registry
- the session file the conversation is written to
- **everything you set up that keeps working** — reminders, watches, rules, overnight work:
  the store they live in, the clock that checks them, and the machine they run on
- **the places** — home, tasks and standing all list the far machine's own disk, because a
  place is a listing of a machine and the machine that matters is the one the work is on
  (*The places over --host*, on the Places page)

The **near** machine — the one you are sitting at — owns the surface:

- your ↑-history and your unsent draft, both keyed by the remote place (`dest:workspace`),
  so what you typed while working on `devbox:code/app` belongs to that place
- the model picker's cached list
- the terminal itself
- **the paths for `/image`, `/attach` and `@` completion**, which are anchored here; a bare
  `/attach` opens the chooser on this machine
- **the browser, the viewer and the file door** — the small `127.0.0.1` listener this
  window opens so that a path in a reply, `/files` and `/files <path>` can show you a file
  that is on the other machine (*Opening files from that machine*)

Because the launch forks before this machine reads any of its own settings, a missing
local `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is not an error on this path. The key that matters is the one
on the far machine.

## How you can tell you are on another machine

**The machine is part of the place, and the link's speed is a measured segment.** There is
no badge, icon or "connected" word. The connection segment begins empty; after its first
empty round trip answers it reads like `devbox · 3ms`. The figure is a rolling estimate,
asked every few seconds and never on the frame path. It is not guessed, so there is no
segment before the first answer and never a `0ms` placeholder.

When a dropped link is being redialled, its sentence wins over the last measurement. The
`connection` segment reads
`reconnecting to devbox — trying for up to 5 minutes`, and it goes away again when the link
is back. No latency check is sent while the redial is in progress.

The workspace is written with the machine in front of it and a colon between, the way you
would type it into `scp`:

- `devbox:/s/c/app` on the status sheet's `place` row
- `devbox:app` in the status line's place segment
- `devbox:/srv/code/app` in full in `/status`

The legend above the input box says the machine too, but as a segment of its own rather
than as a path prefix, because that line carries the model and not the folder:
`devbox · glm-5.3-flash`.

`/status` also names the session file with its machine in front of it, because that is a
path you may want to copy. Once a measurement exists it also says `the round trip to
devbox is about 3ms` under `connection`.

**And if another window is on the same conversation, you can tell from the input box.** A
window that does not hold the keyboard draws one dim line where its box was —
`typing from spark now` on the left, `enter takes it back` on the right — and nothing else
about the screen changes. A window that does hold it says nothing at all. See *Staying on
that machine* for the whole of how two terminals on one chat behave.

The `~` collapse still runs against **this** machine's home directory, so it rarely fires
on a remote path — expect to see the full path.

## Do home, tasks and my projects work over --host

Yes, and they show **the far machine's**.

`space` `space` opens the home of the machine your session runs on: its projects, its
conversations, what each of them ran, and what keeps an eye on it. `enter` on a row opens
that conversation beside the one you are in — the engine gives it a connection of its own
and the chat you came from keeps running, the same door `codeaf resume` uses locally. The right end of the tab bar reads `on <machine>` so you can
see whose afternoon you are looking at, and it is not there at all on a local session.

Three of the seven places still read the machine this window is running on, and each says so
in one line where its rows would be: **spend**, **search** and **memory**. The whole table,
and why the look-stamp behind each tab's number is kept per machine, is on the Places page
under *The places over --host*.

This is new. Home over a connection used to draw one dim line saying its projects belonged
to the wrong machine, and before that it refused to open.

## Can I accept a task, or say it is not right, from a connected window

Yes. A landing that comes home as **your call** draws the same card here that it draws on
the machine it ran on — the reason on one row and `a accept · n not right · s tell it`
under it, with `d let codeaf decide this one` beside them — and every one of those keys is
spent on the engine that owns the work. A conflict's `a resolve it` spends its merge round
over there too.

This was broken until 2026-09-09 and the way it was broken is worth knowing, because you may
still meet it against an older engine. The keys were never refused: the **answers row was
not drawn at all**. You saw

```
? ◆ Port the parser · your call · 42s · 1 file
  nobody could check it
```

and nothing under it. That is codeaf's rule about capabilities doing exactly what it is
written to do — a control with nothing behind it is left off rather than offered and failing
— and what had nothing behind it was the connection: the four doors that decide a landing
had never been given a way to cross it.

So if a card asks and offers you nothing, the engine at the other end is older than this
build. Update it and reconnect. Everything else about the card is unchanged: the reason is
always drawn, whether or not anything can be pressed, because what is being asked is worth
knowing even where you cannot answer it from this window.

A **reading** window — one opened only to watch a task's page — is refused these keys on
purpose, and says `this window is reading this conversation, not typing into it`.

## How do I work on the same conversation from two computers — another window, and another machine

These are two different things and they are easy to run together.

**Another window** is a second codeaf on the *same* machine holding a conversation you can
see on home. Its row says `another window` in the right margin — and `another window · enter
brings it here` while the cursor is on it. `enter` on it never opens a
second copy — one conversation, one writer — but it does something better: it **moves** the
conversation into this terminal. Two presses, the row says `coming here` while it is on its
way, and the other window lands on whatever else it was holding. *Continue a conversation
from another terminal*, on the home page, is the whole of it. (The old answer here was "go
to that terminal, or start a new conversation here", which is no longer the only way.)

**Another machine** is `--host`. The conversation lives over there and your terminal
*attaches* to it: what you type crosses the wire, the work runs on that machine, and the
answer comes back. Close the lid and the turn keeps going if the far end is a session host;
open a terminal somewhere else, attach to the same session, and you are back in it with the
gap replayed. That is what "it just transfers and works" actually is — attaching, not
copying, and the place a conversation lives never moves.

**And the places are neither.** They are a listing of one machine's disk, and they follow the
machine your session is on. Nothing about them opens a second window or moves a conversation.

## What happens when you press enter over --host — your message appears at once, my message disappeared after I sent it over ssh

**Your sentence goes onto the page the moment you press enter**, in the exact place it
will keep, and it is drawn **a shade quieter than usual** until the far machine has
taken it.

That quiet shade is the only thing the wait changes. The `›` mark, the column and the
wrapping are already final, so nothing moves when the line settles — it simply comes up
to its normal brightness. There is no spinner, no badge and no "sending" word: on a
healthy connection the settling happens in a few frames and you will most likely never
notice it.

If the far machine **refuses** the message, the line is **taken back off the page** and
that machine's own reason is printed where it was. A message that was refused never
reached the model, so it is not left in the transcript looking as though it did — the
record of the conversation only ever shows what was actually asked. Your words are still
in the box, so you can send them again.

At this machine there is no such wait, so nothing is ever drawn quietly: your message
appears at full brightness straight away, exactly as it always has.

## Why the status line keeps moving over --host without asking that machine anything

**The far machine tells this one what changed; this one never asks.** The model, the
conversation's name, what has been spent, what the conversation weighs and the effort
level are all sent down when the connection opens and again whenever any of them moves —
at the end of a turn, when the session names itself, after a compaction, and when you
change the model or the effort.

So drawing a frame and typing a key reach across the connection **zero times**. The only
things that travel when you are working are the things that machine cannot know on its
own: the message you sent, the answer you gave a question, the key you pressed to stop
something. Pressing enter is exactly **one** trip across.

This is why the bottom of the screen keeps ticking over a slow link while an answer
streams in, and why the composer does not stutter as you type: nothing you can see is
waiting on the network.

If the link drops, those figures **stop moving and stay where they were** rather than
emptying out — which is the truth, because the conversation is not moving either. The
`connection` segment says what is happening, and everything comes back up to date the
moment the link does.

## Make a hosted conversation think harder — alt+e, /effort and the thinking rung over --host

**It works, and the rung is set on the machine the conversation is running on.** The line
above your message box names it beside the model — `glm-5.3-flash:high` — and all
three doors reach across: `alt+e` walks it a step, pressing it walks it a step, and
`/effort` opens the six rows or takes one outright (`/effort max`). A hosted conversation
nobody has dialled reads `auto`, exactly as a local one does; the wheel comes back to
`auto` off the top over there too, and `/effort auto` clears it back there in one move.

The word you see is the rung **that machine** resolved, not the one this one would have
picked: the ladder is decided where the turn is made, so a level dialled onto the model
over there still wins over there. Setting it is one trip across; drawing it is none — it
rides the same fact set the model and the money ride down on.

An engine too old to know the ladder says so when the connection opens, and then there is
**no rung on the line at all**, the chord does nothing, and `/effort` says
`how hard this conversation thinks is unavailable — this session has no dial onto it`.
That is the absence law rather than a knob that silently fails: update the engine on that
machine and reconnect.

A task's own rung is separate and also crosses — see "Change the model or thinking inside
a task".

## Do I still see the speed and which machine answered when the engine is elsewhere

Yes. All of it crosses the connection, and it is the same row you read locally.

- **The live rate at the right edge** — `38 tok/s` — while the answer is being written.
- **`via <provider>`** beside the model on the line above the message box, as soon as the
  provider writing the answer has named itself and then for the answer that came back:
  the provider that actually served it, and `via parasail · rescued` when a second provider
  finished what the first one started.
- **The phase words** on the row while a request is in flight: `connecting · 1.2s`,
  `first word · 3.1s → parasail at 4.4s`, `thinking · 12s · friendli 38 t/s`,
  `writing · 4s · friendli 61 t/s`, `paced · retry in 6s`, `trying again · 2 of 6`.
- **The `served` row in `/status`** — the endpoint the last answer came from.

**An engine too old to send them says so**, once, after an answer: `this conversation's
engine is an older codeaf, so the provider and tok/s are not shown — they come back once it
picks up this build`. Nothing else changes; update codeaf on that machine and reconnect.

**Nothing is measured on this machine.** Every one of those figures is taken where the
request is made, which is the machine running the conversation, and pushed down to you
the moment it changes. So the clock counts the real wait on that machine, and the rate is
that machine's throughput rather than a guess made from when bytes reached your terminal.

**The clocks are rebuilt against your own.** What crosses is *how long* — how long this
phase has lasted, how long is left before something is done about the wait — never a
timestamp, because two machines need not agree about what time it is. A phase you stop
hearing about goes quiet on the row after fifteen seconds, exactly as it does locally.

**A phase that goes missing is never a wrong one.** If the link is busy the odd reading is
dropped rather than queued, because every one of them is a claim about *now* and the next
one is a second away.

## What does not work over --host

This is the first half of the whole list, so you know before you rely on it, with the
exact sentence each one says.

1. **The git branch is not shown.** The probe would read this machine's repository at the
   remote path, and a coincidence is worse than a blank. It draws nothing and says
   nothing at all.

2. **`/connect` is off, with a reason.** The panel writes to this machine's account store
   and the session reads the other one's. Accounts already connected on the far machine
   keep working. It says exactly:
   `connecting an account is not available over --host yet — the sign-in opens a browser here and the account belongs to the machine over there. accounts already connected on that machine keep working.`

3. **A browser sign-in is off, and the card offers only "not now".** Approving is what
   opens a browser and waits on a loopback port, and the browser is here while the port is
   there. The ask row says exactly:
   `connecting an account is not available over --host yet`

4. **A key sign-in works, unchanged.** You paste a secret into a box on this screen and it
   travels on the wire like every other answer; nothing about it needs a browser or a
   port. This is the one entry on the list that is a capability, not a limit.

5. **`/settings` opens anyway, and says one sentence as it opens.** Half these rows are
   this surface's own — the mouse, the timestamps, the draft — and genuinely apply; the
   other half govern the conversation, which reads them from the far machine's profile. It
   says exactly:
   `these rows are this machine's — the ones that govern the conversation are read from the profile on the other one`

## More of what does not work over --host

The second half of the list, with the exact sentence each one says.

`/cache`, `/permissions`, `/crew`, `/memory <query>`, `/memories`, `/remember`,
`/forget`, `/subharness` and `/harness` describe stores or settings belonging to the
machine that runs the session, but this build has no wire door for them. They do not read
or change this machine's copy. The cache, permissions, crew and harness commands name the
connected machine and say `change it on that machine`; the memory commands say `memory
shows what this machine has learned, and this session is on another`. In particular,
`/cache clean now` deletes nothing here, `/crew pin` writes nothing here, and
`/subharness` does not claim the far registry is empty.

## Did cache clean delete the laptop cache or the remote machine's cache?

Neither. Over `--host`, `/cache`, `/cache clean`, and `/cache clean now` cannot reach the
connected machine's build cache and refuse before touching this machine's cache. The
answer names the connected machine and says to change it there.

## Why didn't /crew pin change the crew on the remote machine?

`/crew` has no far-profile door yet. Over `--host`, the panel and every shortcut —
`pin`, `unpin`, `models`, `cap` — refuse before reading or writing this machine's profile,
name the connected machine, and say to change the crew there:
`devbox owns the crew · change it on that machine`.

## Why does remember over host not say whether memory is off?

The surface has not asked the connected machine whether memory is enabled. `/remember`,
`/forget`, `/memories`, and `/memory <query>` therefore say only that this session is on
another machine; they neither claim memory is off there nor read this machine's memories.

## Does subharness know whether the remote machine has saved programs?

No. `/subharness`, `/sub`, and `/harness` have no door onto the connected machine's
registry yet. They name that machine and refuse; they do not report its registry empty.

6. **The consent card's "always" writes nothing.** No save seams are handed over a
   connection, so the row says `allowed` rather than the local
   `always · saved — /permissions to change`. That is the truth: the answer holds for this
   session, on the far machine, and is written down nowhere.

7. **The approvals cell is the far machine's posture, and moving it moves the far gate.**
   The posture is read from that machine's own rows rather than off this laptop — a cell
   read off the wrong machine would be a safety claim about a machine nobody consulted —
   and `alt+a` or a press on it sets it there. An engine too old to have
   the door says so when the connection opens; the cell is then a reading of the posture
   carried once at the welcome, and every door says the far machine's rules decide.

8. **`/harness` is unavailable.** The registry is the far machine's and this build has no
   door onto it over the wire, so the command says `<machine> owns harnesses ·
   change it on that machine`
   rather than listing this machine's and offering to run them there.

## Task says no task door

The current `--host` protocol carries the far engine's task doors. Starting a task,
listing it on the roster, opening its live room, steering it and stopping it all work on
the other machine. A surface that answers
`room unavailable — this session has no task rooms` is not using that current contract;
update the older codeaf so both ends are the same build and reconnect.

## Why is the task roster empty over host, and can I start a task?

The task roster lists this far conversation's work. Its rows come from the far
   machine's task record, so `ctrl+g` reveals the same landed tasks beside the chat that
   you would see while sitting at that machine. Opening one draws what this window
   already knows — the instruction, and what the far engine last said the work is doing —
   and, while the read is genuinely on the wire, the line
   `loading this task's conversation…` under it. The whole of that is replaced by the
   task's own transcript when it arrives.

   That line is a claim about a read in flight, so it is only ever drawn when there is
   one. A page with no way to ask the other machine does not show it; it says
   `nothing on this page yet — it fills in as the task works` instead, which is the honest
   half of the same sentence. A read that came back with an error is a third thing again
   and says so: `couldn't read this task's conversation · retrying`, with the instruction
   still above it and the beat still going.

   A running row opens too: its page reads the bounded tail on its own beat and fills as
   the far worker writes. `enter` steers that worker and `x` stops it through the far
   engine. Changing its model is still absent.

9. **Starting tasks works on the far machine.** `/task <brief>`, `/task solo <brief>` and
   `/task adaptive <brief>` send the brief to that conversation's engine. The far machine
   shapes, admits and records the work, and the surface answers with `single task <id>
   started · <title>` or `adaptive task <id> started · <title>`. A `propose_task` card works
   the same way: answering yes crosses to the engine, which starts and records the task.
   The rail refreshes from the far task record. Opening its running row never answers
   `room unavailable — this session has no task rooms`; the far task id opens its live
   room, and steering and stopping cross to that task's engine.

10. **`/image`, `/attach` and `@` are local, deliberately** — and this one is a capability as
    much as a limit. The picture or file is on the machine you are sitting at and its bytes
    travel with the message, so a relative path and the completion walk are anchored here
    rather than on the remote workspace. What you attach really does arrive over there; see
    *Attaching files*. The image
    ceilings are applied on this side, with the same words a local session uses:
    `session: <path> is over the 10MB image limit` and
    `session: these images total more than the 20MB a single message may carry — send them across a few messages`

11. **`/export` writes here, and the note says so.** The transcript is assembled from what
    this surface is holding, so the file lands on the machine you are sitting at. The success
    note gains the suffix, exactly:
    ` · on this machine`
    That is a fact about `/export` alone and no longer a fact about the connection — files do
    cross, both ways (*Attaching files*).

12. **Building a new sub-harness works over a connection.** It did not use to: a design's
    card is announced on a subscription rather than on a turn's stream, and this protocol had
    no door for one, so the designer was switched off at the engine rather than left to raise
    a page nobody would ever see. The wire carries that subscription now, and your answer —
    keep it, or drop it — goes back the same way. Running a harness that already exists was
    never affected.

13. **Three of the seven places still read this machine.** Spend adds up the ledger every
    model call on the machine this window runs on writes into, search reads the index of what
    was said here, and memory reads what sessions here learned — and there is no door on the
    wire for any of the three yet. Each place opens, keeps its head, its bar and its box, and
    says one line where its rows would be:
    `spend shows what this machine has cost, and this session is on another`
    `search reads what was said on this machine, and this session is on another`
    `memory shows what this machine has learned, and this session is on another`
    Home, tasks, standing and settings all work and all answer for the right machine.

14. **File paths are clickable again, and this is now a capability rather than a limit.**
    They were not for a wave: the only thing your terminal could open was a path of the
    same name on this machine. Now the far machine is asked whether the file is really
    there, and a path it confirms is a link that fetches a read-only copy and opens that local copy — through a small
    door this window owns on `127.0.0.1`, never through `file://`. A path it has not
    confirmed stays plain text, exactly as at home, and a folder is not linked. `/files`
    opens that machine's folder as a page in your browser, `/files <path>` brings one file
    back and opens it in your own viewer, and a file dragged onto that page lands in the
    conversation's `attachments/`. The whole of it — what turns into a link and what does
    not, where the copies live, the 16MB ceiling, who else can reach those addresses — is
    on *Opening files from that machine*.

15. **A file dropped onto the terminal joins the attachment tray.** A terminal sends a
    drop as a pasted local path. When the paste is only real files, codeaf shows their
    chips instead of putting those paths into the message. Pressing `enter` carries the
    bytes to the far conversation's `attachments/` folder. Generated and viewed pictures
    take the reverse road automatically so their far bytes can be painted in this terminal.

## Reminders and watches over --host — they work, and they belong to that machine

**Standing items cross this wire as ordinary events**, and your answer crosses back as its
own frame — which is why they were the one ambient capability a connection never took away,
back when a design card and an adaptive run's gate had no road here at all. The design card
has one now (*Building a new sub-harness*, above); the run's gate still does not.

So `remind me at 6`, `tell me when CI on main goes red` and `every Monday post the standup`
all work over `--host`. What to know is **whose machine they are on**:

- The item is created, checked and fired on the **far** machine, in the far machine's
  workspace, under the far machine's own profile rules — not this laptop's.
- It keeps working after this window closes and after the connection drops.
- Background checks belong to the **far** machine: the first thing you set up over the
  connection installs its timer, and the `background checks` settings row turns that one.
  Neither ever touches the machine you are sitting at.
- Pausing or stopping one writes to the far machine's store, and a write that store
  refuses is shown as its own refusal rather than redrawn as done.

**Home works and is about the far machine; the standing place works in half.** Home lists
that machine's projects with each one's `◦` item band under it, and the `p`/`s` keys live on
them.

The standing place over a connection draws ONE of its shelves: **what stands anywhere else
on that machine**. The shelf for *what stands on this conversation*, and the one for
*exceptions*, are both empty — not because nothing stands, but because the reading behind
them is a door the connection does not carry. For the same reason the `◦ 2 standing orders`
count at the foot of the task column is **absent** over `--host`: there is no line rather
than a wrong number.

To see and change what stands on the conversation itself, open it on the machine it runs on.
This is a gap and not a design: the doors exist on that machine and nothing carries them
across yet.

Two readings are absent over a connection, and each says nothing rather than guessing:

- **`/status` prints no `keeping watch` line.** The OS timer is the far machine's and its
  state is read from a file on that disk. A line drawn from this laptop's timer would be a
  status about a machine nobody consulted.
- **No row ever shows the firing mark `◐`.** Nothing on any disk says an item is firing at
  this instant — a run is in flight inside whichever process holds the tick lock — so the
  surface does not claim it. That is true locally too.

## Connecting an account over --host

`/connect` is off over a connection. The panel writes to this machine's account store
and the session reads the other machine's. It says exactly:

```
connecting an account is not available over --host yet — the sign-in opens a browser here and the account belongs to the machine over there. accounts already connected on that machine keep working.
```

**Accounts already connected on the far machine keep working.** The tools that use them
run over there. Only new sign-ins are off.

When the conversation asks you to sign in with a browser, the card offers only "not now",
and the ask row says exactly:

```
connecting an account is not available over --host yet
```

Approving would open a browser here and wait on a loopback port there.

**A key sign-in works unchanged.** Pasting a secret into a box on this screen needs no
browser and no port, so that road stays open over `--host`.

## Settings over --host

`/settings` opens over a connection and says one sentence as it opens:

```
these rows are this machine's — the ones that govern the conversation are read from the profile on the other one
```

Half the rows are this surface's own — the mouse, the timestamps, the draft — and those
genuinely apply to what you are looking at. The other half govern the conversation, and
the conversation reads them from the profile on the far machine. Change those over there.

**Asking codeaf to change a setting goes the other way.** `settings` and `change_setting`
run inside the session, which is on the far machine, so they read and write **that**
machine's profile — which is the profile the conversation actually obeys. So over a
connection the two doors land in two different files: the panel edits this laptop, and
asking edits the machine the work is on.

## Approvals over --host

**Approvals are read from the far machine's own settings, not from the laptop you are
sitting at.** The session is built over there, and its tool gate is over there.

Two consequences you can see:

- **The consent card's "always" writes nothing.** No save seam is handed over a
  connection, so the row reads `allowed` instead of the local
  `always · saved — /permissions to change`. That is the truth: the answer holds for this
  session, on the far machine, and is written down nowhere. To make an approval stick, set
  it with `/permissions` on the far machine.
- **The approvals cell is the far machine's posture, and moving it moves the far gate.**
  It is read from the far machine's own rows — not off this laptop; a cell read off the
  wrong machine would be a safety claim about a machine nobody consulted — and `alt+a` or a
  press sets it there. An engine too old to have the door leaves the cell
  a reading of the posture carried once at the welcome, and every door says so.

## Harnesses over --host

**`/harness` is unavailable.** The registry belongs to the far machine and this build has
no door onto it over the wire, so the command says exactly:

```
harnesses are unavailable here
```

It does not list this machine's harnesses and offer to run them over there.

**Building a new sub-harness works over a remote connection.** The tools that design one
are on the far session's belt, the card asking whether to keep the finished page reaches
this window on a subscription the wire now carries, and your answer goes back to the far
machine. It runs there, on that machine's models and under that machine's rules, and the
page it writes is saved there — which is where you would want it, since that is where the
work is. The page is not copied to this laptop.

**Adaptive runs are not something you can start here — and not because of the wire.** No
conversation opens an adaptive run any more, on this machine or the far one: there is no
command, no setting, no tool and no sentence that does it (*adaptive runs*, under *How do I
start an adaptive run*). So a message beginning `orchestrate …` is an ordinary turn over
`--host` for exactly the reason it is an ordinary turn locally. The remote session is also
built with no adaptive runner, and that has not changed: a run's notes, its gauge and its
spending gate arrive on a standing subscription this wire does not carry, and one that —
unlike the harness lane's — replays nothing, so a gate raised while you were away would be
lost rather than waiting for you.

**Running a harness that already exists is unaffected.** The offer card rides the turn's
own stream, so a turn whose words match a registered harness still asks you, and answering
`yes` still runs it over there.

## Attaching a picture or file, a bare /attach chooser, and @ paths, over --host

`/image`, `/attach` and `@` completion are **local on purpose**. The picture or file is on
the machine you are sitting at, and its bytes travel with the message.

So a relative path you type after `/image` or `/attach`, and the `@` completion walk, are
anchored **here** — to the directory you launched from — and not to the remote workspace.
A bare `/attach` opens the add context chooser here too, already browsing the machine you
are sitting at. Files chosen there reach the tray and travel with the next message.

A folder is the one thing that chooser will not take over a connection. Confirming one on
the sheet, or typing `/attach <a directory>`, registers nothing and says exactly:

```
choosing a folder is not available over --host yet — the folders here are this machine's, not the ones the conversation is on.
```

The sheet stays open after a marked folder is refused, with the marks still there. `/folder`
and its `/place` and `/dir` aliases say the same sentence without opening it. If you want a
file that lives on the far machine, a local path will not find it; click it where the reply
names it, or use `/files` — that is the other direction, and *Opening files from that
machine* is the page for it.

The image size ceilings are applied on this side, with the same words a local session
uses:

```
session: <path> is over the 10MB image limit
session: these images total more than the 20MB a single message may carry — send them across a few messages
```

## Exporting over --host

`/export` writes the file **on this machine**, the one you are sitting at. The transcript
is assembled from what the surface in front of you is holding, so that is where it lands.

**There is a door for moving files between the two machines** — it is simply not this one.
`/attach` sends a file to the far machine, and a file the conversation made over there can be
fetched back to this one. See *Attaching files*.

The success note says so. It gains the suffix ` · on this machine`, so the whole note
reads, for example:

```
exported · ~/chat.md · on this machine
```

## --yolo and --no-compact cannot travel

These two flags are refused rather than quietly ignored. They are properties of the
session, and the session is built on the far machine, so a flag typed here has nowhere to
land.

Naming either with `--host` is an error that names the machine the setting lives on:

```
--no-compact and --yolo cannot travel over --host: the session is built on <dest>, so set it there — `ssh <dest> codeaf chat --no-compact --yolo` — or open the settings panel on that machine
```

Set them on the far machine: run `codeaf chat` there with the flags, or open the settings
panel on that machine.

## --model and --reasoning over --host

`--model` and `--reasoning` do work over a connection. They are applied immediately after
the connection opens rather than being carried in it. The session has existed for a
millisecond and nothing has been asked of it, so your first turn rides the model you
named.

`/model` inside the conversation works over the wire as well, and the far machine answers
calls in the order they arrived — a `/model` followed by a message is a message on the new
model.

## When the connection drops

**It redials by itself.** A dropped link is not the end of the session any more — the surface
keeps trying, and when it gets back in it picks the conversation up where you left it,
including the turn that was running while you were gone.

While that is happening the status line says, quietly:

```
reconnecting to devbox — trying for up to 5 minutes
```

Every call still gives up after 10 seconds, so a dead pipe never leaves your terminal frozen.

If it cannot get back at all, you see the sentence you always saw:

```
the connection to devbox is gone — run the same command to pick the conversation back up
```

If the far end said why, its reason is added in parentheses. A connection you closed from
this side reads `this connection is closed` instead.

**The three roads out are three different things now**, which is what makes the above safe.
Closing the window on purpose leaves the conversation running. A link that simply dies means
the same — the far machine assumes you are coming back. Ending the conversation is its own
gesture. Only against a far machine with no session host do all three collapse back into one,
and there the pipe really is the conversation's life.

Nothing that reached the session file is lost either way: the far machine is the only writer of
it, and it flushes on every road out.

A fuller account of what survives, and what a returning window does and does not get back, is
in *When the connection drops* and *Staying on that machine*.

## One headless message over a connection

```
codeaf chat --host devbox --once "text"
```

This is deliberately the same shape as a local `--once` run: the reply goes to stdout, and
tool lines, compaction lines and failures go to stderr, so a script cannot tell which
machine answered. The session is closed when the turn ends.

`codeaf resume` refuses `--once` and points you at the right form:

```
codeaf resume opens the session picker; for one headless message use: codeaf chat --host <dest> --once "text"
```

## Reopening another tab through the local engine

A new local-engine tab carries the window's launch settings, including that it
is an interactive chat. Reopening that conversation by its session path uses
those same settings and rejoins the engine's live work. It does not submit the
message again or wait for its own pending question to finish in another window.
Explicitly different launch flags still use the existing compatibility check.

## Opening full-quality images from an SSH server

To view an original image on your computer, run codeaf locally with `--host` pointing
to the server. The **[open original]** action, a click on the expanded picture, or
**alt+o** fetches the remote file through the existing connection, checks its content,
keeps a named local copy and opens that copy in your system viewer. Repeated opens
reuse unchanged content; a changed remote file is refreshed. A local attachment
keeps its local ownership and does not make that round trip.

If you SSH into a server and run codeaf there, the terminal application and its file
opener are on that server. The original-file action explains how to use the local
`--host` client and shows the original path so you can retrieve it yourself. It does
not launch a viewer on a machine you are not sitting at. The optional cell preview
still scrolls as ordinary terminal text; it cannot display screenshot text at full
resolution. This distinction applies inside tmux too.
