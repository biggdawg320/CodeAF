// ── THE PLACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A person reads the word PLACE, and so does this file. The word carries two
// other meanings in this repository, and both of them are one letter away:
//
//   - [session.PlacesRoot], [app.placesRoot], `placesDirName`, `SweepPlaces`,
//     `homePlacesCol` — the PLURAL, always, and always THE DIRECTORY OF
//     CONVERSATIONS AND PROJECTS ON THIS DISK;
//   - `page`, the identifier for WHICH ROOM, kept because a `page` is what the
//     surface has always called a screen that takes the frame and because
//     `place` on its own is now the interface below.
//
// So: `page` is the id, `place` is the contract, `places` is the disk, and the
// manual and every string a person sees say *place* for the room. This comment
// is the bridge between the three, and it used to say the Go identifier was
// `page` everywhere — which was true until ARCHITECTURE.md named the interface
// and the owner signed it.
//
// THE SEVEN ARE A LIST AND NOT A SWITCH. The tab bar's order, the numbers
// `alt+1`…`alt+7` jump to, and the order `tab` walks are ONE fact, held in
// [placeOrder], so a place added later is a row in that slice and a file.
//
// The rewind timeline is NOT one of them. It is still a page reached by
// `/rewind`, because it is a thing you do to this conversation rather than a
// room in the machine, and putting it in the bar would put a knife in the
// cutlery drawer.

// ── THE CONTRACT EVERY PLACE ANSWERS ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// place is what a page of the switcher must be able to do, and [placeRegistry]
// is the one thing that knows all of them: NOTHING SWITCHES ON A PAGE ID
// OUTSIDE THIS FILE. Before this contract existed the seven rooms were spelled
// out as arms of eleven switches across five files — the frame, the note line,
// the hint, the composer, the alt letters, the time window, the verbs, the
// counts, and the three pointer gestures — so a place added later was eleven
// edits, and a place that answered ten of them was a room with no pointer or a
// tab that never wore its number. Both happened.
//
// A PLACE IS A STATELESS HANDLE AND THE STATE LIVES ON THE APP. The registry is
// package-level and one window's cursor is not another's, so what is registered
// is a value with no fields whose methods reach the app's own field for that
// place — `a.taskSheet`, `a.orders`, `a.mem` and the rest, each declared
// in the same `place_<word>.go` as the handle that reads it. That is what
// "per-place state owned by the place" means here: one file owns the struct, the
// handle and every method the frame can ask of it.
//
// Every method is given the app because a place is a reading of the machine and
// the machine is what the app holds. What no method may do is READ THE DISK ON A
// DRAW: `open` and `tick` are the two that may, and `body` builds rows out of
// what they left behind (ARCHITECTURE.md's three layers).
type place interface {
	// id is which place this is, and it is the key the registry files it under.
	id() page
	// word is the one lowercase word this place is called, on the tab bar and in

	//
	// A PLACE THAT DOES NOT ARM THE CLOCK MUST NOT KEEP IT TURNING. Home has a
	// beat of its own and arms it itself (home.go's [homeEvery]); the tasks place
	// re-reads on the keystroke that walks in. A clock left running on a place
	// that never asked for one is a second reader of the same disk, and walking
	// out of memory onto home used to be exactly that (placecounts.go).
	//
	// IT MAY ALSO HAND BACK A COMMAND. That is where a place asks an engine door
	// off the update loop — the spend place's run-of-seats read is the one that
	// does — because the beat is the moment a place re-reads what it draws and a
	// door asked from Update would freeze the window while the engine answered
	// (offloop.go). The bool says whether the beat goes on; the command, nil where
	// the place has none, runs beside the re-armed clock.

	//
	// IT IS THE PLACE'S OWN SENTENCE AND NOT THE FRAME'S, because the noun in it
	// belongs to the place: what this machine RAN is not what this machine has

	// head and a foot of its own (taskrecord.go). Both are modes that take the

	// — a wrong answer that draws perfectly and that nobody would think to look

	// does not build.
	//

	// strip at the foot displaces nothing. The rows are handed in rather than

	//
	// It is a NAME and not an index, for the reason every restore on this

	// row number, and a cursor compared by number would say a row had changed

//
// IT IS [sheetTabBar] WITH THE TITLES PASSED IN, and it is drawn with that
// function's own geometry — [tabLead], [tabGap], [tabPad] — for the reason that
// function's comment already gives: "this panel IS a tab bar — the same object
// the task strip is, drawn the same way, so that 'which page am I on' is one
// visual question across the app rather than two". The settings panel keeps its
// own inner bar under this one, and the two are told apart by what they are
// made of rather than by a decoration: this one is the places, that one is
// settings' own sections.
//
// ── THE WIDTH LADDER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A bar that is cut in half is a bar that lies about how many places there are,
// so it gives up words in a stated order rather than being trimmed:
//
//  1. every word, every count, with the bar's own air between the chips —
//     while they fit;
//  2. EVERY WORD AGAIN, WITH THE AIR GIVEN UP. When the bar was seven words,
//     they and the padding each chip carries were fifty-seven cells and the air
//     between them six more, so a sixty-column terminal — a split pane, an ssh
//     session from a train, a phone — overshot by three and fell all the way
//     past the middle rung to the single word `home`, because on a quiet machine
//     no place wears a count. The words are what this row is FOR and the space
//     between them is not, so the space is what goes first.
//  3. as many words as fit, in the bar's own order, always carrying the place
//     you are standing in and any place wearing a count, and ending with a dim
//     count of the places that did not fit ([barMoreWord]).
//
// THE BAR IS THE SIGN AND THE FOOT IS THE ROUTE. A row this narrow cannot say
// `tab next place` as well as the words — at rung 3 there are not seven cells
// spare for it — so what the bar owes a person is that the other rooms EXIST,
// and the key that reaches them is on the foot of every place
// ([placeHintTail]), which [hintFit] protects to the last cell there is. A bar
// collapsed to the word `home` said neither of those things, and every other
// place was undiscoverable on exactly the tier where a person is least able to
// go looking for them.
//
// `numbered` is the map ([app.mapShowing]): every chip grows the digit that
// jumps to it, in the cells the words were already in, and the places off the
// bar are drawn after them with theirs — nothing moves that a person has to
// re-find when the map goes away, and the three digits the bar does not show

// showPage opens one place and closes whatever was standing where it is about to
// stand.
//
// IT IS A WRAPPER OVER THE EXCLUSION THAT ALREADY EXISTED, not a replacement for
// it. [app.standDownFullscreen] still closes every page that takes the frame,
// every page still carries its own `open bool`, and view.go's frame still asks
// those booleans in the same order — so `a.page` is a LABEL on state the
// booleans already carry, and the two page-stack laws in chrome_test.go hold
// without an edit to what they assert.
//
// ── EVERY PLACE OPENS, ALWAYS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This function used to have a second half: a place that refused to open put
// back whatever was standing, and three places refused — tasks with no task in
// the world, standing with nothing standing, memory with no store behind it. The
// owner ran the binary on a fresh machine and found that `alt+2`, `alt+3` and
// `alt+4` did nothing at all, because on a fresh machine all three of those are
// exactly the state a new person is in.
//
// SCREEN 1f'S PREAMBLE IS THE LAW NOW: an almost-empty place is the best teacher
// on the machine, so it always opens and spends the whole frame saying what it
// is for. There is no refusal path left here to put anything back with, and each
// place answers an empty world with its heading and its whisper
// (placeprose.go's [placeWhisper]) rather than with a bounce. The one fact a
// place cannot teach its way around — a reading that belongs to a machine this
// process cannot see — is drawn as a single dim line in the place's body
// ([place.remote]), which is still the place being open and saying why it is
// empty.
