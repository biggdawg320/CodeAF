// The render core is two passes and one cache.
//
// PASS 1 — an entry renders ITSELF into rows and remembers them. It re-renders
// when its own text changes or the width does, and at no other time; a frame
// that touches a settled paragraph is a frame that wrapped text nobody
// re-typed.
//
// PASS 2 — [app.layout] joins those rows into the screen list, and it is the
// ONLY place a blank row is ever emitted. That is the whole fix for the gaps
// this surface used to grow: every entry politely left a line above itself, two
// polite entries left two, and nobody owned the result. Entries no longer get a
// vote.
//
// The frame joins [app.window]'s slice of that list and nothing else — no
// transcript rebuild, no re-wrap per keystroke.

// is added and no checkmark, so the emptiness law is kept THROUGH the
// transition rather than around it.
//
// WHY ONLY THE TAIL, AND NOT THE PROMOTED HEAD. The head is
// [app.renderMarkdown]'s output: already-styled spans, already through prose's
// sanitizer, carrying headings, code chroma and emphasis of its own. Repainting
// it would mean either wrapping styled runs in a second foreground — which the
// inner SGR 39s would tear open halfway down the row — or reaching into the
// renderer, and the tail is where the honest answer already is. THE HEAD IS THE

// event — and never by inference from a long wait — the words change. A wait
