// THE ATTACHMENT TRAY: a picture is not a sentence.
//
// Everything else that comes out of the @ completion is TEXT — "@internal/
// session/agent.go" is a word in a sentence, and the agent's read tool resolves
// it if it wants to (files.go says why at length). An image cannot be that:
// there is no tool on the belt that turns a PNG into anything a model can look
// at, so a path typed into the sentence is a path the model can only guess
// about. The picture has to travel as content.
//
// So an image chosen from the completion does not land in the draft at all. It
// lands in a TRAY above it — one dim chip per picture — and the draft stays the
// sentence the person is writing. The chips are what the next message carries,
// they are removed the way the character behind the caret is removed, and they
// survive a refusal: a message the surface could not send is a message the
// person still holds, pictures included.
//
// ── AND ORDINARY FILES RIDE THE SAME TRAY (`/attach`) ───────────────────────
//
// A log, a CSV, a PDF is not a picture and does not travel as content: it
// travels as a FILE, and what the model is told is its PATH, because the belt
// has a `read` tool and a 4MB CSV in the context window is 4MB nobody asked
// for. That is the one difference, and everything else about a file chip is a
// picture chip — the same tray, the same backspace, the same survival of a
// refusal.
//
// WHERE THE BYTES GO IS A QUESTION ABOUT WHOSE DISK IT IS, and there are
// exactly two answers:
//
//   - LOCAL: the session runs on this machine, the path already means something
//     to it, and nothing moves. The message names the file where it sits, which
//     is what internal/remote's image.go already blesses in as many words for a
//     picture that arrives with a path and no bytes.
//   - OVER A CONNECTION: the engine has never seen this disk, so the bytes
//     travel with the message and the engine writes them into that session's
//     own `attachments/` folder before the turn opens — and the path in the
//     sentence is a path on the machine that owns the journal (internal/remote's
//     file.go holds the whole of that law).
//
// The ceilings below therefore apply to the second case and not the first: a
// limit exists because bytes cross a wire, and refusing a file that is not
// going anywhere would be a rule invented for its own sake.
//
// What lives where:
//
//	the tray's state      [app.chips], and [app.sent] while a message is in flight
//	the row above the box [app.chipStrip], drawn by [app.inputBlock] (input.go)
//	what enter does       [app.submitImages]
//	what /image does      [app.attachPath]
//	what /attach does     [app.attachFilePath]
//	what the completion does when the file is an image  [app.completeFile]
//	the gate              session.Config.SupportsImages, wired in cmd/codeaf

// maxAttachBytes is the per-picture ceiling this surface enforces, and it is
// deliberately the SAME number internal/session's own guard uses
// (session/image.go's maxImageBytes) rather than a friendlier one: a photo that
// this tray accepted and the session then refused would be a refusal arriving
// after the message was already on screen, for a reason the person could have
// been told at the door.
//
// It is enforced against the STAT first, exactly as session does, because a
// limit checked after the read is a limit that already pulled a
// multi-gigabyte file into memory to discover it was too big.
const maxAttachBytes = 10 << 20

// maxAttachedFileBytes is the biggest single FILE this surface will put on a
// message that has to cross a connection, and the number is arithmetic on the
// wire's own ceiling rather than a taste.
//
// internal/remote's frameCap is 64MB and it is a cap on ONE LINE: a whole
// message — its words, its pictures and its files — travels as a single JSON
// frame, and bytes inside JSON are base64, which costs A THIRD MORE than the
// file weighs. So 48MB of raw attachment is what an entire message may really
// spend, and 16MB per file leaves room for two large ones, a screenshot and the
// sentence they came with without ever putting the frame within reach of the
// cap. It is not larger because every call on that wire has a ten-second
// deadline (internal/remote's callDeadline): a ceiling much above this would be
// a limit the connection failed before the number did.
const maxAttachedFileBytes = 16 << 20

// maxAttachedTotalBytes is what ALL the files on one message may weigh
// together — two thirds of the 48MB budget above, leaving the rest for the
// pictures on the same tray, which carry their own [maxAttachBytes] each.
//
// It exists because the per-file limit alone does not bound a message: four
// files under the ceiling are still four files on one line.
