// THE CONTROLS SCREEN — the one screen between connecting and the first thing a
// person types.
//
// The setup used to ask three separate questions after the key: a crew chooser,
// then a rails screen with three money rows on it. Five answers, four of which a
// person who has never run the program cannot have an opinion about yet. This is
// the one screen that replaced them, and the rule that decided its contents is
// written in docs/design/onboarding/DESIGN.md: a control belongs here when it is
// NECESSARY TO WORK, MATERIALLY CHANGES THE FIRST EXPERIENCE, and CAN BE
// UNDERSTOOD BEFORE THE PERSON HAS USED codeaf. Two pass — the day's limit
// (money is consequential and an amount can be chosen with no knowledge of the
// engine) and the chat model — and everything else is a setting or a thing to
// be taught at the moment it happens. THE CREW USED TO BE THE THIRD, as a
// choice between three preset words; since 2026-09-24 a task's crew is picked
// per task and asks nothing up front, so it left this screen (/crew is where
// its pins, allowed models and cap live).
//
// SIX LAWS HOLD THIS SCREEN TOGETHER.
//
//   - EVERY VALUE ON IT IS THE RESOLVED ONE. Nothing here is a figure this file
//     knows: the limit and the model are read back through the settings
//     registry and internal/config, so a profile that already has a limit sees
//     THEIR limit and not the default, and an environment variable that owns a
//     row is named rather than quietly overwritten.
//   - THE DEFAULTS ARE ALREADY CHOSEN. Every row opens on the value that is in
//     force, so a person who wants none of this presses enter on `Start a
//     conversation` and has agreed to exactly what they were shown. That is the
//     whole difference between a form and an interrogation.
//   - IT WRITES ONLY WHAT IT WAS GIVEN. Leaving this screen writes the day's
//     limit, because the limit is the field it asked about, and nothing else.
//   - CANCELLING CHOOSES NOTHING. Esc out of the model list leaves the value that
//     was there before it opened. A cursor is not an answer.
//   - THE SCREEN IS THREE SENTENCES LONG. Each control carries one line about
//     what it does and nothing else; the caveats and the exact model ids are
//     behind `?`, on the field a person is standing on. A first
//     screen that has to be read before it can be answered is a first screen most
//     people leave.
//   - IT SPENDS NOTHING. Opening a model list reads the catalog this process
//     already has; nothing on this screen sends a prompt or calls a model.
//
// The example on the right is labelled as an example. It is one request somebody
// could make and the kind of result it leads to, and it moves only when the
// person moves — a deliberate focus change or the arrow keys, never a timer and
// never a keystroke inside a field. No invented cost, no fabricated activity, no
// claim that anything has already run.

// setupControl is one row of the controls screen, in the order tab walks them.

// rows are grouped under it because they are one subject.
