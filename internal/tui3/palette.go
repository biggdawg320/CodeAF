// The model palette: /model with nothing after it, and omp's picker opens.
//
// It is called picker and not palette because [palette] in styles.go is already
// this surface's colour table. The FILE is palette.go because the thing it
// holds is the palette gesture — a filter box you type into, a short list under
// it, arrows to move, enter to switch, esc to close.
//
// Three properties are the whole design:
//
//   - It never fetches on its own. The list was resolved before it opened
//     (models.go), so the first frame after /model is a list and never a
//     spinner; the one fetch it makes is asked for with a key, and the list
//     stays usable while it runs (modelrefresh.go).
//   - It is bottom-anchored and takes the input line's place. The conversation
//     shrinks above it; nothing pops up over the middle of what somebody was
//     reading.
//   - ENTER APPLIES AND THE LIST STAYS UP; esc only closes, and undoes nothing.
//     Two models can be compared on their prices, chosen between and changed
//     back without the list going away ([app.pickerKey] argues it). What esc
//     does give back is the draft that was being typed and the frame — the
//     picker holds its own filter text, and the person's half-written sentence
//     is never in it. It used to close on enter and restore the model in use,
//     which made every comparison a round trip.

// `tools`, `sees`, `draws`, and `fast` and `cheap` to reorder what was left —
// and every one of those words is now an ordinary thing to search for. The
// reason is the table: those terms were asking about the FACTS, and a person
// reading a column of first-token times or prices can see which rows answer
// them without describing the question in a syntax nobody can discover. What a
// person cannot see is where their model's name is in six hundred rows, and
// that is the one job left here.
//
// A QUERY LANGUAGE HAS TO BE LEARNED AND A NAME DOES NOT. `$<0.3` could only
// ever be typed by somebody who had read a page about it, while every person who
// opens this list already knows the name they are looking for — so the box that
// answers only the second is the box that answers for everybody. It also means
// there is no longer a token that silently means something other than itself:
// `fast` searches for `fast`, and the rows that come back are the rows carrying
// those letters.
//
// THE QUERY IS TOKENS AND NOT A PHRASE. A person hunting a model types the
// pieces they remember in the order they remember them, and the pieces are not
// adjacent in the id: "ds v4" is deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash, "claude 4.5" is
// anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5. Whitespace splits, and the terms are ANDed — a
// second word narrows a list, which is the only thing typing more can sensibly
// do.
//
// THE SCORE IS THE ALIGNMENT AND NOT A LADDER OF RUNGS. The matcher pays for
// the best way a term's letters can sit in an id: a boundary bonus for landing
// after a word start, a `/` or a hyphen; a consecutive bonus for a tight run,
// floored so adjacency always beats a gap; the first character's boundary
// doubled, so a word beginning where the id begins is worth the most. A prefix
// therefore outranks a substring which outranks a scattered subsequence —
// the same ordering the tiers used to hold apart, produced by the bonus model
// instead of enforced by it, and "sonnet" over six hundred ids still puts the
// models that really carry the word above the ones that merely contain its

// answering the second somewhere else would make a person leave the list to ask
// it and come back to find their filter gone.

// has measured opens onto exactly those two, with one dim line in the machines'
// place saying why there are none yet ([laneUnmeasured]). It draws no number:
// the emptiness law is about figures nobody took, and it is kept.
//
// It used to refuse to open at all, on the argument that a fold with one dim
// line in it punishes the person for trying. The gesture that punished was the
// one that did NOTHING: the row said `via together` and the key that should
// have shown that machine was dead, while the settings panel's `lane` row
// offered `auto` and `openrouter` for the very same model — two doors onto one
// list disagreeing about what it could do. Owner's report, 2026-09-10.

// that declines to`, and that one was not true where most people read it. Under
// the shipped `simple` routing row NEITHER of them chooses: auto sends no lane
// either ([laneAutoSaid]), so the filled bullet claimed a difference the wire
// does not make. A mark that is wrong on the default install is worse than no
// mark, and the sentence beside each row says what it does in words.

// laneDefaultWord is the row inside the `openrouter` fold that names no machine
// — what this build did before it held an opinion, and what it still does when
// nobody has asked for anything.
