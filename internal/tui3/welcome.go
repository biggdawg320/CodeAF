// THE WELCOME: the first thing an empty session shows, and the last time it
// shows it.
//
// A terminal that opens on a bare prompt is a terminal that tells a first-time
// reader nothing and a returning one less: which model is answering, what it
// will cost to talk to, and — the fact a chat surface is worst at — WHAT WAS I
// DOING YESTERDAY. So an empty conversation opens as ONE CENTRED UNIT and
// nothing else: the wordmark, the model and the crew under it, the message box
// itself with the caret in it, one dim line of things to try, and — only where
// there are any — the sessions this directory was last in, which enter or a
// click opens.
//
// THE BOX IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE EYE IS. It
// used to be a bordered box at the top with the caret alone forty rows below it,
// a full-height column of `+ /task` doors beside nothing, and a status line
// billing `$0.00` for a conversation that had not happened. Every one of those
// was furniture drawn to mark an absence. Now the first keystroke lands where
// a person is already looking, and the frame's ordinary furniture — the input at
// the foot, the legend, the column on the right, the telemetry — arrives with
// the conversation rather than before it (view.go, task.go, render.go each gate
// their piece on this state).
//
// Three rules, and the first two are the whole of why this is not chrome:
//
//   - IT SHOWS ONCE. The first submit, the first key, the first click — any of
//     them and the unit is gone for the life of the surface, and the box is back
//     at the foot of the frame with the keystroke in it. Nothing brings it back,
//     because a greeting that returns is a greeting a person has to dismiss
//     twice.
//   - IT NEVER SHOWS OVER A CONVERSATION. A resumed session has a transcript,
//     and the transcript is the answer to "where was I" — a greeting above it
//     would be the surface answering a question the screen already answered.
//   - IT ANIMATES IN ONCE AND THEN IS STILL. A slow matte sweep across the
//     letters, easing out to static over about a second and a quarter, and then
//     nothing moves on this surface again until the person types. No loop, no
//     flash, no second run: motion that repeats is motion a reader has to learn
//     to ignore, which is the definition of noise.
//
// The animation is counted in FRAME SLOTS rather than measured against the
// clock (app.go's [frameInterval] is the only clock here), so what it looks
// like does not depend on how busy the machine was — and so a test can assert
// the settled state without sleeping through it. A slot is 33ms of wall time
// whether or not a frame was drawn in it (link.go), so the unit takes the same
// second and a quarter to arrive over a connection as it does here.

// The animation's three lengths, in slots of the 33ms paint clock.

	//   - IT DOES NOT DISMISS. The greeting's contract is that any key puts it

	//     IS the place they are starting work, so typing into it keeps it up and
	//     its only exits are esc and the first message ([app.dismissWelcome]).
	//   - IT DOES NOT ANIMATE. The sweep is an arrival, and this unit arrives
	//     every time somebody presses `+`. Motion that repeats is motion a reader
	//     learns to ignore, which is the greeting's own law read the other way,
	//     so the page opens settled ([app.openChatStart] sets step).
	//   - IT CAN SPEAK. A door that refused has to say so where the person is
	//     standing, and while this page is up the transcript is not on the frame
	//     at all (msg below).

	//
	//   - IT SAYS WHAT THIS BOX IS FOR. A heading, one instruction and the folder
	//     the conversation is standing in, above three starting points. Every
	//     later greeting is the model line and the box, because by then the person
	//     knows what they are looking at.
	//   - THE COMPOSER DOES NOT MOVE WHEN TYPING BEGINS. The ordinary greeting is
	//     dismissed by the first keystroke and the box drops to the foot of the
	//     frame, which on a first conversation moves the one thing the person was
	//     aiming at, mid-word. This unit stands until the message is SENT

// The wordmark, four rows of it, and it MUST HOLD A LETTERFORM FOR EVERY LETTER
// OF [product] — [wordmarkRows] skips a letter it has never heard of, so a
// missing glyph is not a build error, it is a word with a hole in it on the
// first screen of a fresh install (TestTheWordmarkCanSpellTheProductsWholeName
// is what holds the two together).
//
// THE WORD IS SPELLED `codeaf` AND DRAWN `CodeAF`. The table is keyed by the
// letters of [product], which is the one spelling every sentence uses, but the
// forms under `a` and `f` are capitals: the owner wants the two letters at the
// end to stand up out of the word (2026-09-17), and a letterform table is the
// one place a drawing may differ from the text without the text changing. The
// terminal that gets the word instead of the drawing still gets `codeaf`.
//
// THE TOP ROW IS THE CAP LINE AND THE BASELINE IS ONE LINE, and both come from
// one fact about box-drawing: a bar sits at the MIDDLE of its cell and only a
// vertical reaches a cell's edge. So a letter whose top is a bar (`c`, `o`,
// `e`, the capitals) tops out half a row below a letter whose top is a stem,
// and a letter whose foot is a stem hangs half a row under one whose foot is
// a bowl. With three rows that put the `d`'s ascender half a row over the
// capitals' tops, which is the one thing a capital is not allowed to be. Now
// the x-height letters live in the lower three rows and leave the top row
// blank; the capitals and the ascender start in the top row, the ascender as
// the half-stroke `╷` so its top is the capitals' bar and not the edge above
// it; and every stem that ends on the baseline ends as the half-stroke `╵`,
// which stops where a bowl's `└─┘` does. A `│` in the bottom row is a
// DESCENDER and nothing else.
//
// It is drawn from box-drawing characters rather than from a figlet font because
// a figlet wordmark is nine rows of hash marks and this surface owns two: the
// letterform here is the same vocabulary the rail and the rules are drawn in,
// which is the whole reason it reads as part of the surface rather than as
// something pasted onto it.

	// what the wave that found this filed it as. The half-stroke closes that
	// cell while keeping the aperture a lowercase `e` has and `a` (`├─┤`) has
	// not — the one cell that tells those two letters apart here. `c` needs no
	// such closing: its right column is blank on all three rows, so the eye
