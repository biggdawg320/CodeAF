// THE SETTINGS PANEL: /settings, or ctrl+, — the FIRST of the three fullscreen
// pages this surface draws at every width, and the one the other two are
// modelled on. The second is the task page (taskview.go's [taskSheet]), which
// ctrl+. opens; the third is home (home.go's [homeView]), which /home and a
// double space open. The phone tier's status deck (statusdeck.go) and tool
// detail (expand.go) take the frame as well, but only at [tierPhone]. All of
// them take the frame WHOLE, and this file is where the grammar for doing that
// was written down.
//
// It is omp's INTERACTIONS sheet over codeaf's own registry, and the whole of
// what this file adds to that registry is a UI SKIN: which tab a row belongs
// under, what it is called there, the one line it says about itself, and which
// widget answers it. NOT ONE SETTING IS DECLARED HERE. Every row comes from
// [config.Settings] — the same rows the v2 sheet renders, written through the
// same writers — because a second place to declare a knob is a second place for
// a knob to disagree with itself.
//
// Four rules hold the design together:
//
//   - THE MAP IS TOTAL over the registry. A row nobody placed would be a row
//     nobody could reach, so chrome_test.go fails the build when a registry key
//     has no [settingMeta]. A new setting lands as one registry row plus one
//     line in [settingUI], which is the same trade omp makes.
//   - The panel is MODAL and fullscreen. A settings sheet is not something you
//     read the conversation past, and the alternative — a bottom-anchored list
//     of twenty-eight rows — would have taken the frame anyway while pretending
//     not to. It was the ONLY such thing for a while and is not any more; the
//     rule it established is that a surface which takes the frame takes it
//     WHOLE, keyboard and pointer with it, and every fullscreen surface since
//     has been written to it. THE THREE ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BY CONSTRUCTION:
//     opening any one of settings, the task page or home closes the other two
//     ([app.openSettings], [app.showTaskPlace] and [app.openHome] each say so),
//     because two pages that both believe they own the frame is a frame that
//     draws one and takes keys for the other.
//   - Every write goes through [config.Setting.Apply], which validates in plain
//     language and persists to the GLOBAL profile. The project layer
//     (<workspace>/.codeaf/config.json) is deliberately not writable from here:
//     it is a file a repository commits, and a panel that edited it would be
//     this surface committing to somebody's repository on their behalf.
//   - A refusal is SHOWN, never swallowed. A pinned row, a seam the door did
//     not wire, a number outside its band — each answers in the registry's own
//     words on the foot line.
//
// The two-space indent, the dim values and the single accent are styles.go's
// palette and nothing new: the panel is a list, and this surface already knows
// what a list looks like (palette.go's overlayRow draws every row here).

// which model is answering it today.
//
// The four class rows above it are the setting; this is the READING of them. Before
// the section existed, "small work" and "careful work" were two model ids with
// no way of finding out what actually ran on them — the roles are declared
// across the binary from init functions (internal/roles' open registry), so
// nothing on screen could name them — and the only way to pin one was to type
// `planner:openai/gpt-5` into a text box from memory.
//
// IT IS A VIEW OF ONE REGISTRY ROW AND NOT A SECOND KNOB. Every pin these rows
// write lands in `models.roles`, the "pinned roles" row they sit under, parsed
// and re-serialized rather than appended — so the section and that row cannot
// disagree about what is pinned, and a role pinned by hand in the text box
// shows here as pinned.

// Capitalized words on this sheet are tab names and this is not one.
