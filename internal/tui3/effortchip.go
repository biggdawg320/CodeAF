// THE THINKING CHIP — how hard this conversation thinks, said beside the model
// that is doing the thinking.
//
//	─ glm-5.3-flash (deepinfra): high · ◇ asks · main* ────
//	› what changed in the relay this week
//
// internal/effort landed the ladder and internal/session landed the dial, and
// the surface had nothing: the only door onto five rungs was a settings row
// that sets the INSTALL's default, which is the wrong scope for the question
// people actually ask. "Think harder about this one" is a sentence about the
// conversation in front of them, and it was answerable only by changing what
// every other conversation on the machine would do afterwards.
//
// So the conversation's own rung gets a cell on the seam, a chord and a
// five-row ladder, and all of them read and write ONE scope —
// [session.Agent.SetConversationEffort], which is sticky in this session's
// meta.json and reaches every turn and every task this conversation hands out.
//
// ── IT SITS BESIDE THE MODEL BECAUSE IT IS A FACT ABOUT THE MODEL ──────────
//
// Until 2026-09-09 this was a chip at the right end of the TRAY, and the seam
// said the rung as a colon suffix on the model id — `glm-5.3-flash:high` — so
// one ladder was spelled two ways on one frame, in two places, and the tray row
// existed on most sessions only because the dial was on it. The seam is where
// the answer belongs: the model, how hard it is being asked to think, and who is
// serving it are one sentence about the next turn, and a person reads them
// left to right on the line their eye already crosses on the way into the box.
//
// The effort follows the model and its provider after a colon. It stays in
// the same cell relative to that identity, with no separate effort badge.
//
// ── WHAT THE CHIP SAYS IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The word is [session.Agent.ResolvedEffort] and never the stored rung. A chip
// that showed what somebody CHOSE would be blank on the ordinary session where
// nobody has chosen anything — and would be a lie on the session where a level
// dialled onto the model itself is winning. What a person wants off a dial is
// the number the machine is running at, so the chip is drawn from the resolver
// and the scope that decided it is nobody's business up here.
//
// ── AND ABSENCE IS A STATE, SO IT IS SAID: `auto` ────────────────────────
//
// THE SHIPPED SETTING IS ABSENCE — [effort.Ship] is [effort.None], nothing is
// asked for and the model thinks however it thinks — so on an install nobody
// has dialled the resolver answers "" and this cell, drawn from that word
// alone, WAS ABSENT ON EVERY FRESH CONVERSATION. Which is to say: on a shipped
// install it was absent always, on the in-process road and the hosted one
// alike, and the only person who ever saw a rung was one who already knew there
// was a dial to turn. The tray chip this replaced had the same hole, and that
// is exactly why the owner never learned the dial existed and asked for one to
// be built.
//
// A CONTROL THAT IS INVISIBLE UNTIL YOU HAVE ALREADY USED IT IS NOT A CONTROL
// (CLAUDE.md's discoverability law). So absence is drawn, by name — `auto`,
// the word the `thinking` settings row has offered for this state since the
// ladder landed ([effortAutoWord]).
//
// THIS IS NOT A BREACH OF THE EMPTINESS LAW. That law refuses a word for a
// number nobody has — `$0.00`, `0 tok` — and auto is not zero thinking. It is a
// decision about WHO DECIDES, it is the decision this install shipped with, and
// a state somebody chose the shape of is a fact to state. The cell is still
// absent where there is no dial at all — no agent, or a far engine whose
// welcome does not carry one ([app.effortDial]) — because that is the state the
// absence law is actually about.
//
// The one place that costs something is the chord: setting the conversation's
// rung cannot move a resolved rung the TURN scope is deciding (the model
// picker's ctrl+t, or `--reasoning`). That is a knob doing nothing, which is
// exactly the defect internal/session/effort.go's own header names — so the
// chord checks and says so, in the words of the door that would move it.
//
// ── IT IS FURNITURE, AND ACCENT FOR ONE MOMENT ─────────────────────────────
//
// THE ACCENT BUDGET is one lit element per screen and this is not it: a rung
// that sat lit above the box forever would spend the budget on a fact that
// changes once a week. So the cell is dim, like the rest of the seam. The
// exception is the moment it CHANGES, when it is briefly the one live thing on
// the frame and takes THE EMPHASIS LAW's two moves — the selected ground and the
// accent on its effort word — and then settles back, the same shape the copied
// rows keep for three seconds after a sweep (dragselect.go).
//
// ── THE PRESS WALKS IT, THE WAY THE PRESS ON A TASK WALKS THAT TASK'S ──────
//
// A click on the cell is [app.cycleEffort] and not a list, which is the gesture
// a person already met on a task: the room panel's thinking row steps the node's
// rung one place and says so in a note (roompanel.go's [app.roomPanelTake],
// taskeffort.go's [app.cycleNodeEffort]). One verb, one gesture, every scope —
// the same rule effortscope.go states about the chord.
//
// THE LADDER KEPT ITS DOOR AND IT IS A COMMAND NOW. The rows with their
// sentences used to open from a click on the tray chip, which is the gesture
// this ruling spends on the wheel; so `/effort` opens them and `/effort <rung>`
// picks one outright ([app.runEffort]). A capability whose only door was taken
// away is a capability that has been deleted by accident, and this one is worth
// keeping: the words with what each one buys is how a person decides between
// them, and the wheel alone can only be walked blind.
//
// AND auto IS THE WHEEL'S LAST STOP AS WELL AS A NAME. The wheel has six stops
// and comes back to absence off the top ([app.cycleEffort] states why), so one
// more press on `max` hands the scope back to whatever stands above it. `/effort
// auto` and the ladder's own top row still do it in one move, which is what a
// person who is five rungs away from it wants.

// effortKey is the chord that walks the ladder, written down once: the router
// binds it, the manual prints it and the menu's foot names it, and a surface
// that printed a key nobody bound would be lying about itself.
//
// The shared chord spelling renders this as opt+e on macOS and alt+e elsewhere,
// matching the project and approvals controls beside it.
const effortKey = "alt+e"

// effortAutoWord is what this surface calls absence: the dial left alone, with
// nothing asked for and the model thinking however it thinks.
//
// IT IS THE SETTINGS ROW'S OWN WORD, taken from internal/config rather than
// spelled again here (CLAUDE.md's one-source-of-truth law). The `thinking` row
// in /settings has offered `auto` at the head of its choices since the ladder
// landed, and the seam calling the same state something else would be two names
// for one answer on one screen — the defect the colon suffix already made once.
var effortAutoWord = config.EffortWord(effort.None)

// effortFlashFor is how long the chip wears its change.
//
// It is shorter than the sweep's three seconds (dragselect.go's [dragFlashFor])
// because the two flashes answer different questions. A copy has to survive the
// person looking away at the window they are pasting into; this one only has to
// outlast the hand leaving the key, and a chord people press four times in a row
// to walk from low to max should have settled before they start their sentence.
const effortFlashFor = 2 * time.Second

// effortFlashMsg is the flash expiring: one repaint, so the chip comes down. It
// is [dragFlashMsg]'s twin and exists for the same reason — without it the
// emphasis would sit on an idle frame until something else asked for a redraw.

// cycleEffort is [effortKey]: the conversation walks one rung up the ladder and

//
// IT STARTS FROM WHAT THE CHIP SAYS. The word on screen is the RESOLVED rung, so
// a cycle that stepped from the stored one would move the chip from a word
// nobody could see to a word nobody expected — the first press on a session that
// has never touched the dial would jump from `high` to `low` because "" comes
// before every rung. Stepping from what is drawn is the only reading under which
// one press means one step.
//
// AND FROM `auto` THE FIRST PRESS LANDS ON `low`, which is the wheel's own law:
// absence is where it starts (effortscope.go states it in full). So the cell a
// fresh conversation draws is the beginning of the walk and not a rung in the
// middle of one.
//
// THE CYCLE HAS SIX STOPS AND absence IS THE LAST OF THEM. It had five until
// 2026-09-15, on the reading that clearing a rung somebody paid for should not
// be one press too many — but the state left out of the wheel was the one the
// install SHIPS at, so a conversation dialled up once could only be put back by
// name, through a door nobody standing at the chip was already in. A walk that
// cannot reach where it started is the worse trade. So `max` steps to `auto`,

// through the one path the chord and the ladder already share, so a rung typed
// and a rung picked cannot mean slightly different things, and the note about a
// level on the model winning is the same sentence in all three.

// used to refuse both with the words that are not rungs at all, on the grounds
// that absence belonged to the settings row; that reading was wrong in the one
// direction that matters. The wheel must not reach absence (a rung cleared by
// one press too many is a rung cleared by accident) but a person must be able
// to GET THERE — the shipped setting is absence, so a conversation dialled up
// once had no way back to what it started at, and the seam now names that state
// on every fresh conversation.
//
// AN UNKNOWN WORD CHANGES NOTHING AND SAYS THE SIX, which is the shape every
// choice this surface refuses takes (crew.go's [app.runCrew]): a refusal that
