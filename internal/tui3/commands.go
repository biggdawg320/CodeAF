// THE COMMAND LIST: type "/" and what you can type appears.
//
// It is the palette gesture again (palette.go) with two differences, and both
// of them come from the same fact — the slash is typed into the DRAFT, not into
// a filter box of its own:
//
//   - it is not modal. The person keeps typing into the box they were already
//     typing in, the list narrows under it, and only ↑/↓/enter/esc are taken.
//   - it opens and closes by itself. A leading "/" opens it; a space closes it,
//     because a line with an argument in it is a line being written rather than
//     a command being chosen.
//
// The table below is the ONE place a command is written down. /help renders the
// same rows (see [helpText]), so a command that exists in one and not the other
// is not possible.
//
// THE OTHER WORDS FOR A COMMAND ARE IN THE TABLE TOO, on the row they belong to
// ([command.alias]). People arrive here from other tools with a vocabulary
// already in their fingers — /clear, /exit, /q, /? — and a surface that answers
// "unknown command" to those is a surface asking somebody to unlearn something
// before it will talk to them. So the words are accepted, and the dispatch
// resolves every one of them through this table ([canonicalCommand]) rather than
// growing a second list of synonyms next to the switch that runs them.

// command is one slash command: what to type, what it takes, and one line.
type command struct {

	// `tab`, the tab bar, or typing a word on home — every one of which has to be
	// learned somewhere else first. The digit on each row is read off the bar's
	// order table ([placeChord]).
	//
	// /spend IS A PLACE AND NOT A READING, WHICH IS WHY IT MOVED. It used to be
	// an alias of /cost, so the one word a person guesses for "what has this cost
	// me" printed THIS CONVERSATION's bill and never said the machine-wide place
	// existed. The two answer different questions — /cost is this conversation,
	// spend is every window, task and standing run on the machine — and the word

	// already been told it may do without asking" — and it sits down here
	// instead for the reason /harness does, stated one row below: [menuRows]
	// shows eight rows at once, position in this table is a claim about
	// frequency, and putting this at the top of the list would have pushed
	// /compact into a scroll to make room for a panel a person opens when

	// type; the row shows the whole word.
	{name: "permissions", desc: "what runs without asking · drop one with d", alias: []string{"perms"}},
	// AND WHAT IS ALREADY TRUE HERE, beside what may run without asking
	// (standingpage.go). The pair is the same question asked twice — one is what
	// this thing may do when you ask it, the other is what it keeps doing when
	// nobody asks — and this row sits under that one for the reason that one
	// sits down here: [menuRows] shows eight rows at once, position in this
	// table is a claim about frequency, and a page a person opens when something
	// has surprised them may not push /compact into a scroll.
	//
	// TWO ROWS FOR ONE COMMAND, the way /export and /crew have two, and for that
	// reason: a single row carrying <words> would make the bare form — the page
	// — unreachable from this list, because [app.runMenu] puts a row that TAKES
	// something into the draft instead of running it.
	//
	// THE WORDS COME FIRST. Making an order is the act this command exists for —
	// the owner's own ruling — and the page is the follow-up a person opens to
	// see what their sentences became. So the row that starts an order leads,
	// and the page rides under it wearing the "…or".
	//
	// The words go through the deliberate door (standmark.go's [app.standingSay]),

	// said in the grammar of the list.

	// THE SHAPES OF WORK THIS CONVERSATION HAS SAVED (harnesspanel.go). It
	// belongs topically beside /connect — one is what this surface may reach,
	// the other is what it has learned to do — and it sits here instead for a
	// reason about the LIST rather than about the command: [menuRows] shows
	// eight rows at once, and a new row put in the middle would have pushed
	// /compact, which people reach for daily, into a scroll to make room for one
	// they will open occasionally. Position in this table is a claim about
	// frequency; this is the honest one.
	// The other words are here because a sub-harness and a harness are the same
	// thing under two names (docs/SUBHARNESS.md), and a person who learned the
	// longer one should not have to find out which half of it this build chose.
	// Every one of them opens the same panel bare, and the same picker with a
	// space after it (harnesspick.go).

	//
	// `/subharness` AND `/sub` USED TO BE WORDS FOR THE ROW ABOVE and are not any

	// later and from evidence — one worker starts, and hands parts out only once
	// it has opened the material and found the width is real (internal/splitgate,

	// has about tasks — set one going, and go and look at the ones that already
	// did.
	//
	// IT IS NOT SPELLED "/tasks", AND THE NEAR-MISS IS THE REASON. The two rows
	// above both mean GIVE codeaf WORK, and a plural sitting among them shared four
	// characters with every one of them: typing "/task" narrowed the list to both
	// errands at once, so the muscle memory for starting work kept landing on a
	// page that starts none. What a person calls this thing is the record of
	// everything the project has run, and "history" is that word — it collides with
	// nothing, and it is what somebody types when they cannot remember that the
	// chord is ctrl+.

// ── `?` — THE KEY A PERSON PRESSES WHEN THEY ARE LOST ───────────────────────
//
// Until this wave `?` was bound to nothing at all. It was an ALIAS of /help —
// `/?`, six characters and a slash you already had to know about — so the
// shortest honest route to the key sheet was a command a person could only find
// by opening the command list, which is itself a door the greeting names in
// four words at the bottom of the screen. Every program with a key sheet in it
// has answered this key since curses existed, and the first thing a developer
// does when a full-screen program stops making sense is press it.
//
// WHAT IT OPENS, AND WHY THAT IS TWO THINGS. `?` means one sentence — SHOW ME
// THE KEYS FOR WHERE I AM STANDING — and this surface has two answers to it
// because it has two screens:
//
//   - In a conversation it runs /help, which is the key sheet: every command,
//     every chord, in the transcript where it can be scrolled and searched.
//   - On a place it draws THE MAP (`alt+.`), which is that place's own key list
//     drawn in the cells the foot was already using ([placeMapWords], SCREEN
//     3b). Printing the sheet from a place would mean leaving the room a person
//     is standing in to answer a question about it, and the map is the answer
//     the surface already has: the chords, and — since row 14 of this wave —
//     only the ones this place really has.
//
// It is one gesture with one meaning and two renderings, exactly as [helpText]
// is one table with two ([app.slash]'s "One source, two renderings").
//
// AND THE ONE THING THAT WOULD MAKE IT WORSE THAN NOTHING: eating a `?` a
// person is typing. The guard is the offer key's guard word for word (keys.go)
// and it is structural rather than clever — THE BOX MUST BE EMPTY. A question
// mark is nearly always the LAST character of a sentence and never the first,
// so a draft with anything in it keeps the key and it types; and every overlay,
// list, card and modal on this surface is read above this rung, so a `?` typed
// into a filter box, a folder picker or a consent question never reaches here
// at all.
const helpAskKey = "?"

// helpAsk is `?` on the conversation's road: the key sheet, over an empty box.

// a person would say it: `there is no manual page named xyzzy` (manualcmd.go),
// `that conversation is not on this machine any more`. The half that mattered
// was already right — it says what to do — so what changes is the register and
// where it points.
//
// AND IT POINTS AT THE LIST RATHER THAN AT A SECOND COMMAND. `/help` is six
// characters somebody who has just mistyped a command has to type correctly;
// `/` is one keystroke, it is the door the greeting already advertises, and
// since row 8 of this wave the list it opens fills the frame and says how many
// rows it is holding back. `?` opens the sheet itself, in one key ([helpAskKey]).
