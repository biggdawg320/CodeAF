// ── DETACH AND ATTACH ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE SURFACE DRAWS ONE CONVERSATION AND POINTS AT A DIFFERENT ONE BY MOVING,
// NOT BY CLOSING. That is the whole of this file, and it is [app.openSession]
// split along the one line that used to make the conversation being left stop
// existing — `a.agent.Close()`.
//
// Detach takes the surface off an agent: it stops every lane this surface holds
// on it, folds the box and the readings that are the PERSON's rather than the
// agent's into a sidecar, and clears the per-conversation fields. The agent
// itself is untouched — its turn goes on streaming into its own journal, its
// tasks go on running, its presence file goes on heartbeating.
//
// Attach points the surface at an agent: it takes up the conversation bundle,
// bumps every lane generation, rebuilds the screen from the agent's own record
// ([app.replay], [app.measureContext]), re-subscribes the standing lanes, joins
// an in-flight turn from its first token ([session.Agent.Attach]) and puts the
// sidecar's readings back.
//
// EVERYTHING NOT IN THE SIDECAR IS REBUILT FROM THE AGENT OR FORGOTTEN. That is
// the bargain that makes this a third of the size of a surface that held N
// conversations: the transcript, the rail, the meters, the pending cards, the
// model and the title are all facts about the agent, and the agent still has
// them.

// aside is a detached conversation's PERSON-SIDE readings: the few things on
// screen that are not facts about the agent and would therefore be lost when
// the surface stops drawing it.
//
// EVERYTHING NOT IN THIS STRUCT IS FORGOTTEN BY A SWITCH AND REBUILT FROM THE
// AGENT ON THE WAY BACK. Adding a field here is adding a thing the surface must
// keep correct while it is not drawing it, which is the expensive kind of
// state; the test is "would a person notice it was gone", not "could we".

	// roster, and the roster is rebuilt below by a replay that arrives over the
