// THE SKILL PICKER: /skill with a space after it, and the shelf is a list you
// can put skills in front of this conversation from.
//
// Until this existed the only way to reach a skill was to hope the model chose
// it by itself. The session side of that already existed — the four doors on
// internal/session's skillattach.go — and this is the surface over them.
//
//	/skill            the whole shelf, the attached ones at the top
//	/skill <query>    the picker: filter, ↑↓, enter toggles one on or off
//	<the request>     enter sends it with the attached skills in front of it
//
// It follows the harness picker (harnesspick.go) everywhere the two errands
// agree — synced off the draft rather than modal, the shared fuzzy scoring,
// the overlay grammar — with ONE difference: the choice is a SET. Enter on a
// row toggles that skill on or off and LEAVES THE LIST OPEN, so three skills
// are three keystrokes and not three commands. Escape closes, and the
// attachment stays: it is held by the session, not by the draft, so it is
// still on three messages later, and the tray's chip above the box is where a
// person can see that it is.

// skillPickListLimit is how far into the shelf the picker reads. It is the
// catalog's own scan bound (internal/session's skillcatalog.go) rather than a
// second number, because the shelf the picker shows and the shelf the model
// is offered are the same shelf.
