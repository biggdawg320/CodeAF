// THE LAW: A HARNESS PAYS NOTHING FOR A TICK OR AN OWNER-PROVEN WAITER THAT
// CANNOT REACH IT, AND IT KNOWS BY NAME WHICH COMMANDS MAY NEVER ANSWER. The
// budget above was once paid serially for every command, and three quarters of
// this package's wall clock was spent running it out (#399). Overlapping the
// named waiters removed the multiplication but left one 150ms settle on nearly
// every drive step whose fake-owned channel was empty.
//
// WHAT WAS BELIEVED, AND WHAT IS TRUE. The reading that opened #399 was that all
// recognised waiters could be dropped immediately. #463 disproved that: these
// commands DO answer, usually from a buffered channel, and the events in it are
// what the streaming tests assert on. The harness therefore never drops a
// waiter merely because its runtime name is in [blockingCommands].
//
// SO THE WAITERS KEEP THE FULL [cmdBudget], and this file deliberately holds no
// knob to shorten it. "Answered in microseconds" is a claim about the scheduler,
// not about the code, and tuning a budget to it recreates the load-shaped red
// #399 exists to remove. harnessdriver_test.go instead asks an exact registered
// owner, on the test goroutine, whether its queue is open and empty and whether
// any goroutine can write it. That fact permits an immediate drop; an unknown
// owner, a queued value and a close all keep the old road. Ordinary work gets
// [workBudget] instead: it always answers, so a healthy run never pays that
// ceiling, and crossing it names a stuck command rather than pretending the
// command returned nothing.
//
// THE DEFAULT STILL OVERLAPS. A named waiter without that owner fact is started
// and left running while the harness gets on with the next message, so a call
// that parks five of them pays one budget rather than five, and each still has
// the whole of its own. That is why the table below must stay complete: a waiter
// missing from it is one the harness waits for on its own, and the package gets
// slower with nothing failing.
//
// WHAT IS CHEAPENED IS THE TICK, where the question needs no scheduler at all.
// [surfaceTick] is replaced by [harnessTick] for this binary, so the surface's
// own constants decide it without starting a real timer: the shortest
// are the paint clock and [resizeGrace] at 80ms and taskmention's at 100ms, and
// every tick at 150ms or longer — the polls, [homeEvery], [farRoomEvery],
// [hostPingEvery] and their kind — is dropped today and would be dropped whatever
// the harness did. [tickBudget] sits above the longest tick that still delivers
// and below the shortest that never does, so it takes back the wait on the polls
// and changes nothing that arrives.
