// THE COMMAND LIST IS THE ONE THING HOME'S COMPOSER DID NOT HAVE. Chat's box
// answers a "/" with an alphabetical menu and enter runs the row; home's box used to
// answer the same characters by starting a conversation with them, which is
// the one screen where a command typed in full did nothing it promised. This
// file is home's half of that parity: the offers in the drop-up, and the enter
// that runs them. The ordering, the token-finding, the sealing AND the choosing
// are not reimplemented — they are the chat composer's own [menu] and its own
// [chooseCommand], run over home's box, so the two surfaces cannot grow two
// answers to what "/mo" offers or to what enter does with the row.
//
// THE DISPATCH IS MOSTLY NOT HERE EITHER. [app.homeSlash] hands the line to
// [app.slash] — the same switch chat's enter runs — through a gate that first
// asks what the command MEANS on a screen with no conversation in front of it.
// That gate is the second half of this file and it replaced a ruling: that the
// conversation-scoped commands act on the conversation this window holds behind
// the screen, "which is parity rather than a limitation: the window always
// holds one." The window does always hold one. What it does not do is DRAW one,
// and a command whose answer is drawn where nobody is looking is not parity.

// homeCommand is one slash command, offered in the drop-up because what was
// typed matches its name or one of its aliases. It is numbered OUTSIDE the
// [homeRowKind] iota block for [homePlace]'s reason: that block is edited by
// other lanes in the same wave, and a constant appended to it is a conflict
// over a line that says nothing.

// ── THE GATE: WHAT A COMMAND MEANS ON A SCREEN WITH NO CONVERSATION ─────────
//
// Every command used to go straight to [app.slash], and the header above calls
// that parity. It was parity for about half of them and a trapdoor for the
// rest: ten commands answer by opening a bottom-anchored overlay, which a place
// cannot draw and the keyboard cannot reach (pages.go's [app.closeModals] tells
// that story), and sixteen more answer with a note written into a conversation
// nobody is looking at. So the same three characters did three different things
// depending on which command they spelled, and two of the three were silence.
//
// EVERY COMMAND HAS A FATE HERE, IT IS WRITTEN DOWN ONCE, AND IT IS ON THE ROW
// BEFORE THE KEY IS PRESSED. [homeFate] is that one place: the drop-up draws it
// in the row's margin ([app.homeCommandRow]) and [app.homeSlash] switches on it,
// so the list cannot promise something the dispatch does not do. A command added
// to the table with no fate fails the build rather than drawing a blank margin
// and quietly taking the last road ([TestEveryCommandHasAFateAtHome]).
