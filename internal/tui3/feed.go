// feed is the reducer that turns one agent's event stream into transcript
// entries. It owns the list, the assistant block being streamed into, the
// reasoning block being streamed into, and the turn every new entry is stamped
// with — everything an event can move — and it knows nothing whatever about how
// any of that is drawn.
//
// ONE REDUCER PRODUCES EVERY TRANSCRIPT'S ENTRIES; A VIEW MAY INSTALL HOOKS,
// NEVER A COPY.
//
// The law is stated here because this codebase has already paid for breaking
// it. The task room grew a hand-copy of this whole family — roomFormTool,
// roomAnnounceTool, roomBeginTool, roomCloseTool, roomSettleCompaction and the
// rest of the eleven in room.go — and being the copy is exactly why a room did
// not learn that a tool FINISHED, why a retry inside a task was invisible, and
// why an end event paired by one rule out in the conversation and another in
// there: every event kind added since had to be wired twice, and the second
// wiring is the one nobody remembers. The copies are gone
// (docs/design/lens/DESIGN.md, Decision 1), and a surface that needs the
// reducer to do something extra installs a [feedHooks] function instead; it
// does not write a second reducer, which agrees with this one on the day it is
// written and drifts from it by the next wave.
//
// IT IS EMBEDDED IN [app] AND IN [taskRoom] RATHER THAN HELD BESIDE THEM, which
// is what keeps the several hundred existing readers of `entries`, `live`,
// `think` and `turn` spelled the way they have always been spelled on both
// surfaces: the fields moved house, not name.
//
// THE LENS MAY LOWER SALIENCE; IT MAY NOT DROP A FACT. What a page does with an
// entry — folds it, dims it, puts it behind a keypress — is the page's; whether
// the entry EXISTS is this file's, for every surface at once, and
// salience_test.go walks every event kind through both to hold it.
type feed struct {
	entries []entry
	// live is the assistant entry currently being streamed into, or -1.
	live int
	// think is the reasoning block currently streaming, or -1 (thinking.go).
	think int
	// turn counts the person's messages. It groups tool calls into clusters
	// and is what ctrl+o folds and unfolds.
	turn int
	// mdAt is when the live block's prefix was last promoted to markdown
	// (render.go's [promoteBlock]). It belongs beside `live` because it is that
	// block's clock and nothing else's: it is set where the block is opened, and
	// a surface holding its own copy would be a second answer to "how old is this
	// rendering" for one block.
	mdAt time.Time
	// settledTurn is the last turn whose BOUNDARY HAS PASSED — the turn
	// [app.settleTurn] has walked — and it is what makes a delta arriving after
	// that boundary land settled rather than opening a block nothing owns.
	//
	// THE DEFECT IT CLOSES (#225). A turn ends twice on a surface and, in
	// between, a stream can still speak: the tail of a reply the provider had
	// already buffered, a straggler behind a stop. That delta found no live
	// block, opened a second one under the answer, and the two costs landed
	// together — the new block was live with no boundary left to settle it, and
	// its mere presence demoted the answer above it into narration, which is
	// drawn PLAIN (hierarchy.go). What the person read was their markdown reply
	// come back as the characters it was typed as, until they asked something
	// else. It is zero until the first turn ends, and turn numbers count from
	// one, so nothing is settled by accident.
	//
	// A SURFACE THAT NEVER ARMS IT NEVER TAKES THE LATE ROAD, which is the task
	// room today: a node's page has one ending per step and no second one to fall
	// between, so it leaves this at zero and every delta grows the live block.
	settledTurn int
	// pendingReplyTags arrived before the first words of the answer they label.
	pendingReplyTags []session.TaskReplyTag
	// asked and askedTurn are HOW MANY TIMES THIS TURN HAS BEEN ASKED AGAIN, and

	//
	// IT IS THE ONLY COUNT OF A FAILING REQUEST THIS SURFACE HAS. The engine's
	// retry event carries a sentence and no arithmetic today (failurerow.go
	// states the seam), so what the give-up row says about how many tries were
	// spent is what this reducer WATCHED go past — honest about being that, and
	// counted here rather than on either surface so that the conversation and a
	// node's page cannot answer the question differently.
	//
	// The turn is carried beside it because a count is per-request-ladder and a
	// ladder belongs to one turn; comparing rather than resetting means no caller
	// has to remember to clear it, which is exactly the kind of remembering that
	// leaves the second turn of a session reporting the first one's failures.
	asked, askedTurn int
	// lastAsk is the retry this feed drew most recently, kept whole so that the

	// col is this page's live token column — the books its lane has heard,
	// and the pair in motion (tokencol.go). It is HERE and not on the surface

	// and a task room each carry one, opened with the work and read by the same
	// drawing through [deck.col].

// with the model's working written into it.

// found no live block and opened a second one under it. What the reader saw was
// one flowing answer with somebody else's sentence wedged between two of its
// paragraphs, as though the model had quoted them mid-thought. The words were in
// the right place in TIME and in the wrong place on the PAGE, and the page is
// the only record anybody reads back.
//
// SO THE STREAMED BLOCK STAYS WHOLE. The line is appended after it and the live
// index is left where it was, which is still valid — appending never moves an
// earlier entry — so the next delta grows the block it was already growing and
// the person's line stays below it. A tool row is deliberately NOT treated this
// way: a call lands in place, between two paragraphs, because that is where it
