// THE FIRST-RUN SETUP, AND THE MODEL DOOR THAT MAY COME BACK.
//
// A fresh install used to open on an empty chat and the first thing the product
// said was a provider error. Now the door lets that launch open with no key
// (cmd/codeaf's chatv3.go) and this screen asks for what a first day needs, in
// TWO steps: the key every model call rides, and then one screen of controls —
// the day's spending limit, the model you talk to, and the crew codeaf works
// with. Under a minute; every control opens on the value already in force; the
// way out is `Start a conversation`.
//
// THE SECOND STEP IS ONE SCREEN AND NOT THREE QUESTIONS. It used to be a crew
// chooser followed by a rails screen carrying three money rows, which is five
// answers from somebody who has not yet run the program once — and four of them
// about limits they cannot have an opinion on yet. The rule that decided what
// survived is in docs/design/onboarding/DESIGN.md, and onboarding.go holds the
// screen itself. The rails this no longer asks about — the per-plan question and
// the conversation ceiling — keep the defaults docs/LIMITS.md states and are
// changed with /budget, beside the spending page that explains them.
//
// Four rules, and each is a thing the person is protected from:
//
//   - THE CONTROLS SHOW ONCE. A marker in the profile says they were shown
//     (internal/config's firstrun.go), and skipping counts as shown. The key is
//     different because it is not a preference: with no key the default model
//     provider cannot work, so its one-step connection returns on a later local
//     interactive launch until it is answered.
//   - IT ASKS ONLY WHAT IS MISSING. A key in the shell, a crew already chosen,
//     a ceiling already written — each drops its step. A person who has some of
//     it configured sees only the rest, and one who has all of it sees nothing.
//   - IT STEALS NO KEYSTROKE FROM A CONVERSATION. The first-run questions open
//     only before anything has been typed. A returning key door may stand over
//     an existing conversation, but an attempted send opens it before the draft
//     is cleared, so connecting and pressing enter again sends the same words.
//   - IT SPENDS NOTHING. A pasted key is checked only for shape. The browser
//     exchange creates a key but makes no model call, so no prompt is sent and
//     no model charge can be made during setup.
//
// IT PRECEDES THE WELCOME BOX. The box is what an empty conversation shows; this
// is what it shows before that, and the box's arrival animation starts fresh the
// moment this screen goes ([app.endSetup]).
//
// Every write goes through the settings registry rows — the key row, the crew
// row, the daily budget row — so what this screen lands in the profile is
// byte-for-byte what /settings, /crew and a hand edit would have landed, and
// changing any of it later is those three doors.

// setupStep is one of the two questions.

	//     does, so the screen a person arrives at is three sentences long however
	//     much they read on the way.
	//   - limitText and limitTyped are the day's ceiling as it is being edited,
	//     with limitTyped telling an untouched field — which writes back the
	//     figure it drew — from one somebody has cleared on purpose.
	//   - modelOpen, modelAt, modelTop and modelFind are the model list: a
	//     viewport and a filter over the WHOLE catalog rather than a truncation
	//     of it, because a form with five rows must still reach two hundred
	//     models.
	//   - reviewOpen is the optional reading of the settings this screen
	//     deliberately does not ask about, example is which illustration the
	//     right-hand column is showing, and seeded says the screen has already
	//     been read from the profile once — so coming back from the step behind

//
// AN EMPTY PROFILE DIRECTORY IS THE NORMAL CASE, NOT THE ABSENT CASE, AND

	// the one object that is supposed to say "this is still the same program".
