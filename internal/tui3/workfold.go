// ── THE LAW THIS USED TO STATE, AND THE RULING THAT REVERSED IT ─────────────
//
// ~~A ROOM FOLDS NOTHING. The chip is an affordance of the conversation and it
// earns its place there. A turn out in the thread is a question somebody asked
// and the answer they were given, and the machinery between the two is work
// they delegated precisely so they would not have to watch it — so it
// collapses, and the page reads back as the exchange it was. A room is the
// opposite errand. It is the page somebody opened BECAUSE they want to read the
// machinery, and a node's whole life is one long turn with a report at the end
// of it — so the same rule swallowed the entire page the instant the node
// stopped running, leaving `▸ worked · 10 tool calls · ctrl+e` and the report
// under it. It is stated as an absence of folds rather than as a fold that
// opens itself, because [deck.workOpen] is the READER'S own answer and a
// default that had to be inverted for one kind of page would give that map two
// meanings.~~
//
//	> RULED BY THE OWNER, 2026-09-01 (issue #252, ruling 1): FOLD THE PAST.
//	> "The task page folds settled work into phase chips by default; the
//	> machinery stays one keypress away (ctrl+e / scroll-up). This reverses
//	> the written law at workfold.go:26-52 … and the three tests pinning it."
//
// THE ARGUMENT THE RULING ENCODES, because the struck text above is a good
// argument for the wrong page. It optimises the RARE visit — the audit — at the
// cost of the common one. A person goes to a task to steer and to check, not to
// read a transcript, and a page built on the premise that every call must be
// read is the industry's linear machinery scroll reproduced one level down. The
// reversal was possible without giving up the audit because the old law's own
// objection — a chip per TURN swallows a page that is one turn — is answered by
// folding per PHASE instead ([derivePhaseFolds]): settled machinery and its
// narration collapse together, while the latest paragraph and live frontier
// remain visible. And [deck.workOpen] keeps its one meaning: chips default shut
// and the reader's expansion is still the reader's.
//
// THE DOORS, all three, because DISCOVERABILITY BEFORE PURITY: `ctrl+e` opens
// the newest chip ([app.toggleLatestWorkfold]), a click opens any of them
// (app.go's [app.press]), and a scroll up at the top of a room opens the one
// nearest the top (room.go's [app.roomUnfoldAtTop]) — which is what keeps the
// disclosure ladder from dead-ending (docs/THREAD-UX.md).

// ── A PHASE IS SETTLED WORK WITH A SETTLED PARAGRAPH AFTER IT ───────────────
//
// derivePhaseFolds is the room's chips. A PHASE is the settled work — thought,
// calls, compaction, the surface's own notes — that precedes a settled block of
// the node's prose. A step's introducing narration belongs to the same chip as
// its calls. The latest paragraph stays visible; if another step follows it,
// that paragraph becomes working narration and folds with that next step.
//
// THE LIVE FRONTIER NEVER BECOMES A SETTLED PHASE. A run with no settled
// paragraph after it never closes, so this walk mints no chip over it. The
// independent live policy can compact that unowned frontier (livesteps.go);
// opening it retains the room's whole-screenful tool tail.
//
// WHAT NEVER FOLDS, AND WHY EACH ONE. A run carrying any of these keeps every
// row it has, exactly as the conversation's `blocked` runs do:
//
//   - THE PERSON'S OWN WORDS — the brief, and every correction they typed into
//     running work. A FOLD MAY NEVER HIDE THE PERSON'S WORDS ([groupBreaks]),
//     and an elbow ends a run for the same reason it ends one out in the thread.
//     The brief keeps its own three-lines-and-a-door instead (brieffold.go).
//   - A FAILED CALL. ONLY FAILURE SPEAKS on this surface, so the one row that
//     was allowed to raise its voice may not then be filed away by a chip.
//   - AN ASK — a consent question, a task proposal, a standing card. It is a
//     thing the work could not decide alone, and the record of what the person
//     answered is the only account of where the next hour came from.
//   - A CALL STILL IN FLIGHT, which is not settled work and therefore not part
//     of a settled phase at all.
//   - A SEAM, for [deriveWorkfolds]'s reason: a fold that swallowed one would be
//     claiming the page above it is the same unbroken page.
//
// THE FINAL REPORT STANDS BY CONSTRUCTION. It is the last settled paragraph, so
// it is the block the last chip stops at rather than a case anything tests for.
//
// Nothing here is journaled and nothing is summarised: a chip states counted
// facts about the rows it covers, and a phrase that paraphrased the work would
// be a second account of it that can drift from the work
// ([app.workfoldLabel]).
