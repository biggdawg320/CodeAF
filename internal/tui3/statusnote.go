// ── /status AND /cost: THE STATUS LINE, ASKED OUT LOUD ──────────────────────
//
// The row at the bottom of the frame answers both of these questions already,
// and it answers them by dropping whatever does not fit: at [hudTight] the
// cache share and the forecast are gone, and at [tierPhone] nine of eleven
// facts have moved to a sheet a FINGER opens ([app.deckPress]). A person on a
// keyboard, on a narrow terminal, with the mouse turned off (config's ui.mouse)
// has no door onto any of it. These two commands are that door.
//
// THEY ARE NOTES AND NOT PANELS. Everything else that shows a list on this
// surface takes the screen — the picker, the settings, the sheet — and that is
// right for a thing you ACT on and wrong for a thing you READ: the answer to
// "what has this cost me" is three lines long, it is wanted while a turn is
// running, and it is wanted again in ten minutes with the first answer still
// above it to compare against. A note stays in the conversation and scrolls
// with it; a sheet has to be dismissed before the person can type the next
// thing, which is the one thing they opened it to decide.
//
// AND NEITHER OF THEM ASSEMBLES A METER OF ITS OWN. /status prints
// [app.deckItems] — the same list, built by the same functions, that the phone
// sheet draws — and /cost prints the figures the status line's own formatters
// make of the same fields. A second assembly of the context meter is exactly
// what statusdeck.go's list exists to prevent, and a command is not an
// exception to it.

// statusText is /status: every fact the status line can carry, one per line.
//
// The list is [app.deckItems] whole, because the phone sheet and this command
// are ONE surface asked for in two ways — its head even says "status"
// ([deckSheetTitle]). A row that appears on one and not the other would make
// "what does this session say about itself" a question with two answers.
//
// Its differences from the sheet are about the MEDIUM rather than about the
// facts:
//
//	identity       the build and file path are not status-line segments at any
//	              width — they are things a person copies into another program
//	              — and a note is selectable text while a sheet at forty-four
//	              columns would cut either. /help prints the file for the same
//	              reason.
//	a zero bill   the status line keeps "$0.00" because it is a LIVE row, and a
//	              segment that came into existence on the first priced turn
//	              would shove every segment beside it sideways. A note is
//	              written once and read once, so design-law-v2 §16 applies to it
//	              plainly — and /cost's answer to the same session is "nothing
//	              spent yet", which this list has to agree with.
//
// The crew used to be a third difference — a line this command added under the
// model and the sheet did not have. It is on [app.deckItems] now, directly under
// the model, so the two surfaces say it the same way and this function no longer
// places it (statusdeck.go says why it is the full reading there and one word on
// the live row).

// statusItems is the whole list /status prints: [app.deckItems] with the three
