//go:build e2e

package e2e

// TestTUIE2E is the ambient side of v3, driven end to end: the real binary, a
// real terminal, a real model, and the screen read back with capture-pane.
//
// Every subtest builds its own CODEAF_HOME and its own repository, and NOT ONE
// STRING IS WRITTEN DOWN HERE. Every needle comes through [say] out of the table
// in tuiwords_test.go, which an ordinary untagged test reads back against
// internal/tui3's own sources — so a sentence the surface stops drawing turns a
// four-hundred-millisecond gate red on the pull request that removed it, rather
// than turning this seventeen-minute suite red in a wave nobody ran it in. That
// is issue #184's whole mechanism, and it exists because this file spent a week
// waiting for a home that had been redesigned out from under it.
//
// ── HOW TO RUN IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//	go test -tags e2e -count=1 -timeout 120m -v ./internal/e2e/
//
// Forty minutes is enough for TestTUIE2E alone (about seventeen). The FULL
// tagged package — ManualOnTheWire, QuestionsE2E, roomfeed, families, custody,
// contracts — does not fit in forty: Spark's #807 run hit the ceiling before
// TestTUIE2E started. Prefer `make test-e2e-tui` for the ambient surface, or
// give the whole package two hours. It needs a provider key and tmux, costs a
// few cents. The key is resolved the way the product resolves one ([liveKey]:
// OPENROUTER_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, then the profile's api_key row).
// CLAUDE.md's Tests section says the same thing.
//
// ── TWO WIDTHS, AND THE REASON IS IN THE PRODUCT ────────────────────────────
//
// Home at rest is seven panels, and the width chooses the columns
// (internal/tui3's homegrid.go): two from a hundred and ten cells, three from a
// hundred and seventy. There is NO CARD AT REST at any width; the one card left
// stands beside a SEARCH, from a hundred and thirty-six cells (homebridge.go).
// So a subtest that reads that card types first and runs at [tuiWide], and a
// subtest about the panels runs at [tuiPlain], where the left column holds
// `needs you`, `threads` and `projects` and nothing is cut at [tuiCardAt].

// unset CODEAF_PROFILE_DIR looks like by the time it reaches the surface — so a
// person who had just installed codeaf and typed `codeaf` was never shown the
// screen that connects a provider. Every unit test of that screen named a

// in their shell, so it was green everywhere and broken for exactly the one
// audience it exists for.
//
// SO IT IS RUN AGAINST NOTHING. [emptyHome] creates a directory and not one thing
// more, and [startFresh] takes every provider key and the profile override OUT of
// the environment rather than passing them through it. A fixture that pre-created
// a config file would hide the failure it is here to catch, because the failure
// IS emptiness being read as absence.
//
// AND IT COSTS NOTHING. There is no key on this machine, so there is no wire

// testTaskRoomKeepsSpace is #457/#486's acceptance ON THE REAL SCREEN: the door
// home yields inside a task's record, where a bare `space` already means page
// the card.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS MEASURES WAS INTRODUCED BY THE FEATURE IT SHIPS WITH. #457
// widened `space space` so it opens home from every place and not only from a
// conversation, and the widened door is read at the bottom of the place router
// — ABOVE each place's own reading of the key. The record is a mode of the
// tasks place whose arm sits in that reading ([app.taskSheetKeyPress]), and its
// map spells the page key `pgdown`, `ctrl+f`, `space` ([app.taskCardKey]). So a
// roster filter left holding ONE space — which is exactly the state the door's
// own first press leaves, and which draws nothing a person can see — armed the
// door on a box the record types nothing into, and the next space, pressed to
// scroll, walked the person out of the record and onto home.
//
// WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT ONLY IN internal/tui3. The unit test beside the fix
// (TestSpaceInTheTaskRoomPagesTheCardAndDoesNotOpenHome) drives the same three
// keys through the same router, and it is the cheap gate. What it cannot say is
// that a person doing this at a terminal — a real task, started the ordinary
// way, read back off the project's own record — lands where the router says
// they land.
//
// IT IS READ IN A SECOND WINDOW, AND THE FIRST SCREEN THIS SUBTEST EVER DREW IS
// WHY. `enter` on the roster has two doors and the row chooses between them
// ([tasksPlace.enter]): over a node THIS session's graph is still holding it
// opens the live room, which is a fullscreen surface of its own and not the
// mode this test is about; over work no window is holding any more it opens the
// record card. So the task is started in one window and read in the next, which
// is also how a person meets a finished task — the record outlives the session
// that ran it.
//
// IT IS DELIBERATELY THE CHEAPEST TASK THERE IS — `/task solo` on a one-file
// brief, the cheapest shape a task comes in. The measured run
// lands in about thirty seconds and costs five cents.
