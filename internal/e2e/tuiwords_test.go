// tuiwords_test.go is THE ONE PLACE THE TMUX SUITE'S LITERALS ARE WRITTEN DOWN,
// and the cheap gate that keeps them true.
//
// The tmux suite beside this file (tui_e2e_test.go, build tag `e2e`) waits for
// strings on a real screen. Every one of those strings is a sentence the product
// spells somewhere in its own sources, and when a wave respells one the suite
// does not fail loudly — it waits twenty seconds for a screen that will never
// arrive, and the person reading the failure has to work out which of forty
// needles moved. That is exactly what happened between 2026-08-23 and the home
// redesign: seven of nine subtests were waiting for a home that no longer
// existed, and nothing in the tree said so until somebody spent seventeen
// minutes and a real model finding out (issue #184).
//
// SO THE NEEDLES LIVE HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE, and this file's own test — which
// needs no model, no tmux and no build tag — reads the surface's sources and
// asserts that every one of them is still spelled there. Deleting a string from
// internal/tui3 turns THIS test red in four hundred milliseconds, on the pull
// request that deleted it, instead of turning the tmux suite red in a wave
// nobody ran it in.
//
// THE TABLE IS THE ONLY DOOR. The tmux suite reaches a literal through [say],
// which fails the test on a name that is not in the table, so a needle cannot be
// added to the suite without being written down here — and the second half of
// the gate ([TestEveryWordInTheTableIsWaitedForBySomething]) reads the suite's
// own source back and fails on an entry nothing waits for any more. The two
// halves together are what keeps this a source of truth rather than a second
// copy that drifts.

// tuiWord is one literal the tmux suite waits for on a real screen.
//
// THE SCREEN AND THE SOURCE ARE TWO DIFFERENT FACTS and the table carries both.
// Most sentences this surface draws are one constant and the two are the same
// string; some are composed at the draw — `↑↓ pick · enter open · tab next
// place` is two constants joined — and a gate
// that grepped for the whole painted line would fail on a sentence the code
// spells perfectly well in two halves. So `source` is what must stand in the
// sources, and it defaults to `screen` when the two agree.

	// A ROW THAT NAMES A KEY DOES NOT SPELL THE GAP ITSELF. The surface drew

	// — and eleven rows of this table went on waiting for the brackets while
	// their `source` (the word alone) kept the gate perfectly green. That is the
	// hole issue #998 is: a needle half of which nothing checks. Naming the key
	// here puts the whole needle through [keyedWord], so the next wave that
	// respells the grammar respells one function and every row moves with it.
	key string
	// source is the substring that must still stand in `pkg`'s own non-test
	// sources. Empty means "the source spells it exactly as the screen does".
	source string
	// pkg is the package directory that owns the spelling, relative to the module
	// root. Empty means internal/tui3, which owns nearly all of it — the few
	// entries that name another package are words the ENGINE writes and the

	// be looking in the wrong tree.

	// delete rows out of.

// tokensPkg is the SHARED GLYPH VOCABULARY, and it is where every mark on this
// surface is now spelled: the icons wave took the literals out of internal/tui3

// the surface would be looking where the surface no longer writes one.
