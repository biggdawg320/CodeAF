// The glyph repertoire tier (12.7).
//
// One axis, [GlyphSet], swaps the CHARACTERS used for meanings 5.17 already
// fixed — 1:1, inside our own language. It is not a skin: 8.3's refusal of
// oh-my-pi's nerd-font PRESET (its colours, its brackets, its powerline chrome,
// its status-bar layout) is untouched, and nothing here changes a hue, a
// separator, a bracket, a breakpoint or a line grammar.
//
// The governing invariant, stated once: the tier changes which glyph is drawn
// in a cell; it never changes how many cells a line occupies, which token tints
// it, or where a segment sits. Flipping the tier must not move one column —
// which is why every glyph on both sides of every binding measures one cell
// under both shipping rulers, asserted by glyphset_test.go rather than hoped
// for.
//
// Two rules decide what the tier touches (12.7 B):
//
//  1. Icons for meaning, geometry for structure. A slot whose glyph carries a
//     semantic — a state, an attention, a place, a prompt — is upgradable. A
//     slot whose glyph is line geometry — a separator, an accent rail, a
//     spawn-tree corner, a gauge step, a sparkline cell, a diff sign — is not.
//     Box drawing and block elements are already the right characters for a
//     grid, and an icon there would be strictly worse.
//  2. BMP private-use only, Font-Awesome-4-era and Powerline first. Those
//     codepoints have sat at the same addresses since Nerd Fonts v1 and are
//     present in every patched font, including minimal Powerline-only patches.
//     nf-md-* (Material) is refused: Nerd Fonts v3 relocated the whole set into
//     plane 15, so a v2-era patched font has nothing at the new addresses.

// GlyphSet is the glyph repertoire tier: which characters say the 5.17
// meanings. It composes with [Profile] and [Focus] and changes neither.
