// learning loops that were "landing soon" and were still the only readers of
// their own values a wave later, and the models group carried a hand-copied
// slot list that had gone out of step with the roles table in both directions
// at once — a row for a thing that is not a slot, no row for two things that
// are. Both are the same failure and this file is the gate against it.

// Every role the router has gets a row, and every row of the models group that
// binds a role binds one the router actually has. A sixth role appears on the
// sheet without anyone editing internal/config; a role deleted from the table
