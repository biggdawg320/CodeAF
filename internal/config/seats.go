// THE THREE SEATS EVERY DOOR SITS SOMEBODY IN, RESOLVED ONE WAY.
//
// A run needs its crew named before it can start: the worker that does the
// work, the planner that structures it, the checker that reads the result.
// Every door — `codeaf do`, `plan run`, `plan new`, `exec`, a saved program —
// resolves them here, through one ladder, so a pin said in the product's own
// vocabulary holds on every surface (#166 was the day it did not).
//
// THE LADDER, ONCE PER SEAT:
//
//  1. the flag, which is what this invocation said — a ONE-TASK PIN;
//  2. the environment, which is what this campaign said — a pin too;
//  3. a one-task `--pin`, then the profile's pin (/crew pin);
//  4. THE ROUTER, for every seat nothing above named: the task is classified
//     and the seat picked for it (internal/crewroute, [RouteCrew]).
//
// THERE IS NO FIFTH RUNG. A seat nothing pinned is routed; it never falls
// back to a model this build chose for everybody, and the check seat never
// quietly inherits the planner's model because only the planner was named —
// a person who pinned the planner said something about planning.
//
// IT ALSO REPORTS WHICH RUNG ANSWERED, because the defect this file was
// written for was invisible from outside, and a run whose receipt names the
// rung can be checked by the script that ran it.

// SeatRole is which of the three seats one answer fills, by the name a person
// reads. It is on the [Seat] so a seat can name its own flag and variable.
