	// a card that waits for `enter`. It is a BOOLEAN because the two behaviours

	// one-line what's-new notes a new build may say. It is one row and not two

	// in four alphabets, or who asks for pages of repeated output outside a code

	// small sizing call reads the brief first, because a yes from that call is

	// THE PLANNED-GRAPH ANSWER IS GONE, and with it the last way a preference

	// now — one worker that divides itself from the material — and there is no
	// second road left to prefer: no chat door reaches the planner at all, not a
	// setting, not a hand on the belt, and not a form of words somebody types

	// the items its evidence enumerates against a six-item floor; `judgment`

// glance: "no money at all" where the code means "no ceiling at all". Every
// other kind of row has a word for its off state ([Setting.EmptyLabel]) and a
// dollar row cannot borrow one, because its reading is a formatted number and
// therefore never empty. So the word goes where a row already says the dim true
// thing beside its value: the receipt.
//
// It is EXPORTED because the surfaces say it too — the v3 spend place's pointer
// line and the settings tab's `today` reading both have to spell "nothing bounds
// this" and there is one spelling of it.

// its off state, and the one place each rail's own word for zero is written
// down: `no limit` on the day and the conversation, `never asks` on the consent
// gate, `practice off` on the carve-out, whose zero switches practice off rather
// than uncapping it. Two things follow for free, and both are the reason it is
// spelled this way rather than as a second receipt:
//
//   - THE EDIT BOX OPENS EMPTY on a row that holds nothing. Every surface
//     already blanks the empty label before it seeds the box, so a person
//     editing "no limit" is offered a place to type a number rather than a
//     sentence to delete first.
//   - THE RECEIPT IS FREED FOR A FACT. `no limit` is not a receipt — it is the
//     value — and while it sat in the receipt column there was nowhere left to
//     say what the row is actually doing right now ($4.25 today, this one $0.41).
